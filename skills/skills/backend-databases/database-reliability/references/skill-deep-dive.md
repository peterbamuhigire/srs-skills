## 2. Toil Reduction — What to Automate

| Toil Task | Automation Target |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Manual schema changes | Rolling migration tool with review gate |
| Replica rebuilds | Automated from backup on failure detection |
| Backup execution | Scheduled, self-monitoring, alerting on failure |
| Failover | MHA/Orchestrator automated promotion |
| Connection kill on exhaustion | ProxySQL kill-idle-connections rule |
| Slow query log review | Automated digest to ticketing system |
| Disk space warnings | Auto-purge old partitions or alert-to-expand |

**Rule:** Do it twice manually, then automate it.

## 3. Change Management for Databases

### The Expand-Contract Pattern (Zero-Downtime Schema Changes)

Never deploy code and schema changes simultaneously. Use expand-contract:

**Phase 1 — Expand (backward compatible):**
```sql
-- Add column as nullable, no constraints yet
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN customer_tier VARCHAR(20) NULL;
```

**Phase 2 — Backfill (run in batches, avoid locking):**
```sql
-- Batch backfill to avoid long lock
UPDATE orders SET customer_tier = 'standard'
WHERE customer_tier IS NULL
  AND id BETWEEN ? AND ?
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Phase 3 — Deploy new application code** (now reads/writes new column)

**Phase 4 — Contract (add constraints after code is live):**
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders MODIFY customer_tier VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'standard';
```

**Phase 5 — Drop old column** (after confirming old code paths are gone)

### Migration Rules

- Every migration MUST have a rollback (down migration)
- Never rename a column — add new, backfill, drop old
- Never change column type in-place on large tables — use pt-online-schema-change or gh-ost
- Test migrations on a clone of production data before applying
- Apply migrations before deploying code that requires them
- Store migration sequence numbers; never two engineers modifying the same object concurrently

### Change Freeze Windows

| Period | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Friday 3pm – Monday 9am | No schema changes or major config changes |
| Major product launches | 48-hour freeze before and during |
| Incident in progress | No changes until incident resolved |
| Error budget >70% consumed | Freeze non-critical changes |

---

## 4. Backup Verification Runbook

**Key principle:** Replication is NOT a backup — it cascades corruption. RAID is NOT a backup. A backup is only valid after a successful restore test.

### Backup Strategy (Three Tiers)

| Tier | Storage | Retention | Use Case |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Hot | Fast SSD, local/NAS | 7 days full + hourly incremental | Node replacement, rapid failover |
| Warm | Slow block storage / S3 | 30 days full + daily incremental | Application error recovery, forensics |
| Cold | Glacier / offline tape | 1–7 years | Compliance, disaster recovery |

### Backup Verification Runbook

Run weekly on a test instance. Automate and alert on failure.

```bash
# 1. Restore latest backup to test instance
xtrabackup --prepare --apply-log-only --target-dir=/backup/latest/
xtrabackup --copy-back --target-dir=/backup/latest/
chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql && systemctl start mysql

# 2. Verify row counts match production (alert if delta >0.1%)
mysql -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;" restored_db

# 3. Verify checksums match production
mysql -e "CHECKSUM TABLE orders, users, products;" restored_db

# 4. Log timing and emit metrics
echo "$(date): Restore OK in ${ELAPSED}s" >> /var/log/backup-verify.log
curl -X POST "$METRICS_ENDPOINT" -d "backup.restore.duration=${ELAPSED}"
```

**Alert if:** restore fails, row count delta >0.1%, checksum mismatch, restore duration +50% above baseline.

## 5. Monitoring Pyramid

Four layers. Monitor bottom-up but alert top-down (business impact first).

### Layer 1 — Infrastructure

| Metric | Alert Threshold | Critical |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `disk_usage_percent` | >80% | >90% |
| `disk_iops_utilization` | >70% provisioned | >90% |
| `cpu_usage_percent` | >80% sustained 5min | >95% |
| `memory_used_percent` | >85% | >95% |

### Layer 2 — MySQL Process

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected';     -- alert if / max_connections > 0.8
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_buffer_pool_read%'; -- hit rate; alert if <95%
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G  -- Seconds_Behind_Master, Slave_IO_Running, Slave_SQL_Running
```

### Layer 3 — Query

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Slow_queries';          -- alert if >1% of Questions
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Created_tmp_disk_tables'; -- alert if >5% of total tmp tables
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS\G                       -- TRANSACTIONS section: lock waits

-- Top slow queries (performance_schema)
SELECT digest_text, count_star, avg_timer_wait/1e12 AS avg_sec
FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
ORDER BY avg_timer_wait DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### Layer 4 — Business / Data Health

```sql
-- Data freshness (alert if no new orders in 5 min during business hours)
SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders;

-- Row count anomaly (alert if daily delta >3x 30-day rolling stddev)
SELECT table_name, table_rows FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'production';
```

---

## 6. Alert Fatigue Prevention

### Alerting Decision Matrix

| Condition | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| SLO budget >70% in <half the period | Page on-call | Imminent SLO breach |
| Replication lag >30 seconds | Page on-call | Data divergence risk |
| `max_connections` >90% | Page on-call | Connection exhaustion seconds away |
| Disk usage >90% | Page on-call | Imminent crash |
| Primary failover occurred | Page on-call | Verify data integrity |
| Slow query rate spike >5x baseline | Create ticket | Degradation, not outage |
| Disk usage 80–90% | Create ticket | Trending to critical |
| Buffer pool hit rate 90–95% | Create ticket | Memory pressure building |
| Replication lag 5–30 seconds | Dashboard only | Normal catch-up |
| CPU 60–80% | Dashboard only | Not yet saturated |

### Multi-Window Burn Rate

Alert when consuming error budget faster than sustainable:

| Window | Burn Rate | Action | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 5 min | >14x | Page immediately | SLO breach in <1 hour |
| 1 hour | >6x | Page on-call | SLO breach in <6 hours |
| 6 hours | >3x | Create ticket | SLO breach in <24 hours |

---

## 7. Capacity Planning

### Data Growth Projection

Run weekly and store results. Project: `days_to_limit = (disk_limit_mb - current_size_mb) / growth_rate_mb_day`.

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name,
  ROUND((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS size_mb
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('information_schema','performance_schema','mysql')
ORDER BY size_mb DESC;
```

### When to Scale vs. Shard

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Disk >70%, growing >5GB/day | Add storage or archive old data |
| Read IOPS saturated, writes normal | Add read replicas |
| Write throughput saturated | Scale vertically or shard |
| Single table >100GB and growing | Consider partitioning |
| Single table >500GB with heavy writes | Consider sharding |
| CPU consistently >70% | Profile queries first; scale if no low-hanging fruit |
| Connections >80% `max_connections` | Add ProxySQL pooling first |

**The boring database principle:** Prefer vertical scaling and query optimisation. A well-tuned single primary + replica cluster handles most SaaS workloads under 10TB. Sharding is a last resort.

## 8. Incident Response Runbook

### Step 1 — Assess (first 2 minutes)

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected';  -- connection pressure?
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G                            -- replication running?
SHOW PROCESSLIST;                              -- what is running?
```

### Step 2 — Immediate Mitigation (first 5 minutes)

```sql
-- Kill long-running blocking queries (>30s, not sleeping)
SELECT id, user, time, state, LEFT(info,100) AS query
FROM information_schema.processlist
WHERE time > 30 AND command != 'Sleep' ORDER BY time DESC;

KILL QUERY <id>;  -- kill query, keep connection
KILL <id>;        -- kill connection

SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS\G  -- check TRANSACTIONS for lock waits
```

### Step 3 — Diagnose (5–15 minutes)

```sql
-- Recent slow queries from performance_schema
SELECT digest_text, count_star, avg_timer_wait/1e12 AS avg_sec,
       sum_rows_examined/count_star AS avg_rows_examined
FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
WHERE last_seen > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
ORDER BY avg_timer_wait DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Also check: tail -100 /var/log/mysql/error.log
```

### Step 4 — Failover / Mitigation

```bash
orchestrator-client -c graceful-master-takeover-auto -alias mycluster
# or: masterha_master_switch --conf=/etc/mha/app.conf --master_state=dead
```

### Step 5 — Verify Recovery

```sql
CHECKSUM TABLE orders, users, products;  -- compare to pre-incident baseline
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G                      -- Seconds_Behind_Master = 0?
CHECK TABLE orders, users EXTENDED;      -- detect corruption
```

### Step 6 — Post-Mortem Template

```
Incident ID | Date | Duration | SLO Impact (minutes) | Severity P1/P2/P3
Timeline: first signal → ack → root cause → mitigate → restore
Root Cause:
Detection Gap (why wasn't this caught earlier?):
Action Items: [ ] short-term (owner, date)  [ ] long-term (owner, date)
What went well | What went poorly
```

---

## 9. Connection Exhaustion Response

```sql
-- Immediate: generate KILL statements for idle connections >60s
SELECT CONCAT('KILL ', id, ';')
FROM information_schema.processlist
WHERE command = 'Sleep' AND time > 60;

-- Short-term: bump max_connections (each connection ~1MB RAM overhead)
SET GLOBAL max_connections = 500;
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Max_used_connections';
```

**Long-term:** Deploy ProxySQL to pool many app connections into a small number of backend connections (e.g. 1000 app → 50 MySQL). Set `wait_timeout=300` and `interactive_timeout=300` to auto-kill zombie connections.

---

## 10. Replication Failure Recovery

### Identify the Failure

```sql
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
-- Key fields:
--   Slave_IO_Running: Yes/No
--   Slave_SQL_Running: Yes/No
--   Last_SQL_Error: error message
--   Seconds_Behind_Master: lag in seconds
--   Retrieved_Gtid_Set / Executed_Gtid_Set (for GTID replication)
```

### Duplicate Key Error (row-based replication)

```sql
-- Use sparingly; skips one event
STOP SLAVE;
SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER = 1;
START SLAVE;
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
```

### GTID-Based Skip (preferred with GTID replication)

```sql
-- Get the failing GTID from Last_SQL_Error
STOP SLAVE;
SET GTID_NEXT='<source_uuid>:<transaction_id>';
BEGIN; COMMIT;  -- inject empty transaction
SET GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC';
START SLAVE;
```

### Rebuild Replica from Scratch

```bash
xtrabackup --backup --target-dir=/backup/replica-rebuild/
xtrabackup --prepare --target-dir=/backup/replica-rebuild/
xtrabackup --copy-back --target-dir=/backup/replica-rebuild/
chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql

# Start MySQL with replication paused, then configure GTID
mysqld --skip-slave-start &
mysql -e "CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='primary', MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1; START SLAVE;"
mysql -e "SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G"
```

## 11. Security Incident Response

**SQL injection detected:** Enable general log, kill sessions from attacking IP, block at firewall, rotate credentials immediately.

```sql
-- Enable audit log
SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL general_log_file='/var/log/mysql/general.log';

-- Rotate credentials
ALTER USER 'appuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<new-strong-password>';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- Audit for new rogue accounts
SELECT user, host, Super_priv FROM mysql.user
WHERE Super_priv = 'Y' OR File_priv = 'Y'
ORDER BY password_last_changed DESC;

-- Remove unauthorised user
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* FROM 'suspicious_user'@'%';
DROP USER 'suspicious_user'@'%';
```

**Credentials exposed:** Rotate immediately, audit `mysql.general_log` for that user in past 24 hours, check for new accounts, review privilege escalation.

---

## 12. Planned Maintenance Checklist

**Pre (T-48h):**
- [ ] Notify stakeholders (2 weeks notice required per SLA for planned downtime)
- [ ] Verify backup is complete and tested; rehearse on staging clone; time it
- [ ] Document rollback procedure; designate incident commander

**During:**
- [ ] `SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;` if taking write traffic offline
- [ ] Apply changes incrementally; verify after each step
- [ ] Monitor: `tail -f /var/log/mysql/error.log`

**Post:**
- [ ] `SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G` on all replicas — confirm replication healthy
- [ ] `CHECK TABLE` on modified tables; verify application queries
- [ ] `SET GLOBAL read_only = OFF;` restore normal thresholds; update runbook

---

## 13. Chaos Engineering for Databases

GameDay exercises to test failure modes before they happen in production. Always run on staging first. Have an incident commander. Document findings.

| Exercise | Method | What to Measure |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Primary failover | `kill -9 $(pgrep mysqld)` | Detection time, promotion time, data loss |
| Connection saturation | `sysbench --threads=500 --time=60` | Alert trigger time, ProxySQL queue depth |
| Disk fill | `dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/lib/mysql/fill_test bs=1G` | Alert trigger, replica impact (clean up after) |
| Slow query injection | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE YEAR(created_at)=2023` | Slow query alert fires within SLO threshold |
| Network partition | Block replication port between primary and replica | Replica behaviour, lag accumulation, alerting |

**Cadence:** Primary failover quarterly; connection saturation monthly (low-traffic). Never run GameDay during business-critical events or when error budget is <30% remaining.

---

## 14. Anti-Patterns in Database Operations

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Using replication as a backup | Corruption and user errors replicate to all nodes — no recovery point |
| Manual ad hoc changes in production | Untested changes, no rollback, untracked in version control |
| Averages in latency monitoring | Hides the tail; p99 of 2 seconds invisible in a 20ms average |
| Deploying code and schema simultaneously | Cannot roll back code without breaking schema, or vice versa |
| Setting `max_connections` very high without pooling | 1000 connections = 1GB+ RAM overhead; starves buffer pool |
| No index on foreign key columns | Every DELETE/UPDATE on parent causes full table scan on child |
| Storing secrets in `mysql.user` with wildcard hosts `%` | Any network path can authenticate; blast radius is entire dataset |
| Testing backups by checking file existence | File can exist but be corrupt; only a successful restore proves backup validity |
| Running `ALTER TABLE` on large tables during peak hours | Table lock or ghost row overhead causes latency spike under load |
| Ignoring replication lag until it is critical | Replica serving stale reads; failover to a lagging replica risks data loss |

## Quick Reference: MySQL Ops Commands

```sql
-- Health snapshot (run first on any incident)
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected';
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Slow_queries';
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS\G
-- Connection audit by user
SELECT user, host, COUNT(*) AS n FROM information_schema.processlist
GROUP BY user, host ORDER BY n DESC;
-- Table sizes (top 20)
SELECT table_schema, table_name,
  ROUND((data_length+index_length)/1024/1024,1) AS size_mb
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','information_schema','performance_schema')
ORDER BY size_mb DESC LIMIT 20;
-- Unused indexes (count_star = 0 = candidate for removal)
SELECT object_schema, object_name, index_name
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
WHERE index_name IS NOT NULL AND count_star = 0
  AND object_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema');
```
