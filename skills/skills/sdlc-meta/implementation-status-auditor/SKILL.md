## Use When

- Conduct a comprehensive implementation status audit of any software project. Produces structured documentation in docs/implementation/review-{date}/ with gap analysis, schema audit, integration status, completion blueprint, and prioritized action...
- The task needs reusable judgment, domain constraints, or a proven workflow rather than ad hoc advice.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is unrelated to `implementation-status-auditor` or would be better handled by a more specific companion skill.
- The request only needs a trivial answer and none of this skill's constraints or references materially help.

## Required Inputs

- Gather relevant project context, constraints, and the concrete problem to solve; load `references` only as needed.
- Confirm the desired deliverable: design, code, review, migration plan, audit, or documentation.

## Workflow

- Read this `SKILL.md` first, then load only the referenced deep-dive files that are necessary for the task.
- Apply the ordered guidance, checklists, and decision rules in this skill instead of cherry-picking isolated snippets.
- Produce the deliverable with assumptions, risks, and follow-up work made explicit when they matter.

## Quality Standards

- Keep outputs execution-oriented, concise, and aligned with the repository's baseline engineering standards.
- Preserve compatibility with existing project conventions unless the skill explicitly requires a stronger standard.
- Prefer deterministic, reviewable steps over vague advice or tool-specific magic.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating examples as copy-paste truth without checking fit, constraints, or failure modes.
- Loading every reference file by default instead of using progressive disclosure.

## Outputs

- A concrete result that fits the task: implementation guidance, review findings, architecture decisions, templates, or generated artifacts.
- Clear assumptions, tradeoffs, or unresolved gaps when the task cannot be completed from available context alone.
- References used, companion skills, or follow-up actions when they materially improve execution.

## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Release evidence | Implementation status audit report | Markdown doc in `docs/implementation/` covering feature-by-feature status, evidence, and gaps | `docs/implementation/status-audit-2026-04-16.md` |

## References

- Use the `references/` directory for deep detail after reading the core workflow below.
- Load `references/plan-implementation.md` when audit findings need to become a phased implementation plan.

## Overview

This skill transforms Claude into an elite Enterprise Software Architect and Technical Auditor. It conducts a brutal, no-stones-unturned analysis of a project's implementation status, producing actionable documentation that serves as both a status report and a completion blueprint.

**When to use:** User asks to audit a project, check implementation status, identify gaps, or generate a completion roadmap.

## Core Workflow

### Step 0: Prepare Output Directory

Create the review directory with today's date:

```
docs/implementation/review-{DD-MMM-YYYY}/
```

Example: `docs/implementation/review-21-Feb-2026/`

If the directory exists (re-run), append a sequence: `review-21-Feb-2026-v2/`.

### Step 1: Discovery Phase (Gather Inputs)

Before any analysis, systematically collect all project materials. Use the Explore agent and direct file reads.

**Required discovery targets:**

| Source | What to Find | How |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Database schemas | Tables, migrations, ERDs | Glob `**/*.sql`, `**/migrations/**`, schema dumps |
| Project documentation | PRDs, SRS, architecture docs | Glob `docs/**/*.md`, `**/AGENTS.md`, `**/CLAUDE.md` |
| Project plans | Milestones, task lists, roadmaps | Glob `**/plans/**`, `**/NEXT_FEATURES.md`, `**/requirements.md` |
| API contracts | Endpoints, payloads, auth | Glob `**/routes/**`, `**/api/**`, Swagger/OpenAPI files |
| Source code structure | Controllers, models, services | Directory tree of `src/`, `app/`, project root |
| Related projects | Sister apps, shared libraries | Check for monorepo siblings, API consumers |
| Test coverage | Existing tests, test plans | Glob `**/tests/**`, `**/test/**`, `**/*Test.*` |
| Config & infra | CI/CD, deployment, env | Glob `**/docker*`, `**/.github/**`, `**/deploy/**` |

**Discovery SOP:**

1. Read `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` at project root
2. Read `docs/` directory tree for all planning/architecture docs
3. Scan database directory for schema files and migrations
4. Map the source code directory structure (top 2 levels)
5. Identify all API route/controller files
6. Check for sister/related project references
7. Locate test files and coverage reports

### Step 2: Analysis Phase (Five Audit Pillars)

Analyze gathered materials against five pillars:

#### Pillar 1: Schema & Data Model Reality Check

Cross-reference database schemas against project documentation.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] All planned entities have corresponding tables
- [ ] Foreign keys enforce documented relationships
- [ ] Multi-tenancy isolation is schema-enforced (tenant_id scoping)
- [ ] Indexes support documented query patterns
- [ ] Normalization level is appropriate (3NF minimum for transactional)
- [ ] Audit columns exist (created_at, updated_at, created_by)
- [ ] Soft-delete support where documented
- [ ] Character set/collation consistency (utf8mb4_unicode_ci)

**Cross-reference with:** the `mysql-engineering` skill for schema standards.

#### Pillar 2: Implementation vs. Plan Gap Analysis

Compare current codebase against project plans and requirements.

**Classification system:**

| Status | Definition | Evidence Required |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Complete** | Feature fully functional | Routes + Controllers + Models + UI + Tests |
| **Partial** | Some layers exist | Schema exists but no endpoints, or UI stub only |
| **Phantom** | In plan, zero footprint | No schema, no code, no routes — only in docs |
| **Undocumented** | Exists in code, not in plans | Code present but no matching requirement |

**Cross-reference with:** `feature-planning` skill for spec-to-implementation mapping.

#### Pillar 3: Cross-Platform & Integration Integrity

Evaluate API contracts and data flow between systems.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] All documented API endpoints exist in code
- [ ] Authentication/authorization covers all endpoints
- [ ] Response payloads match expected client schemas
- [ ] Pagination implemented where needed
- [ ] Error responses follow consistent format
- [ ] Webhook/callback endpoints documented and implemented
- [ ] Data sync mechanisms between platforms verified

**Cross-reference with:** the `api-design-first` skill (pagination and error-handling standards) and the `dual-auth-rbac` skill.

#### Pillar 4: Technical Risk & Debt Assessment

Identify blockers, debt, and architectural concerns.

**Risk categories:**

- **Critical Blocker** — Prevents next milestone, must fix immediately
- **High Debt** — Works now but will break at scale
- **Medium Debt** — Suboptimal but functional
- **Low Debt** — Cosmetic or minor improvement

#### Pillar 5: Completion Blueprint

Transform gaps into an actionable completion plan.

**Blueprint structure:**

- Group remaining work by module/feature
- Prioritize by dependency order (foundations first)
- Estimate complexity (S/M/L/XL)
- Map each item to the skills needed for implementation
- Define acceptance criteria for each item

### Step 3: Documentation Output Phase

Generate the following files in the review directory:

```
docs/implementation/review-{date}/
├── 00-executive-summary.md          # Project health overview
├── 01-schema-audit.md               # Database & data model analysis

## Cross-Skill Integration Map

This auditor leverages other skills for both analysis and recommended actions:

| Audit Area | Analysis Skill | Action Skill |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Database schema gaps | `mysql-engineering` | `mysql-engineering` |
| Missing features | `feature-planning` | `feature-planning` |
| API gaps | `api-design-first` | `api-design-first`, `dual-auth-rbac` |
| Multi-tenant issues | `multi-tenant-saas-architecture` | `multi-tenant-saas-architecture` |
| Documentation gaps | `doc-architect` | `update-claude-documentation` |
| Testing gaps | `sdlc-documentation` | `sdlc-documentation` |
| Planning gaps | `sdlc-documentation` | `sdlc-documentation` |
| UI issues | `webapp-gui-design` | `jetpack-compose-ui` |
| Mobile integration | `android-development` | `android-saas-planning` |
| Security concerns | `vibe-security-skill` | `web-app-security-audit` |
| Code quality tooling | `php-modern-standards` | `php-modern-standards` |
| User docs missing | `manual-guide` | `sdlc-documentation` |
| Module architecture | `modular-saas-architecture` | `modular-saas-architecture` |

## Iterative Drilling

After the initial audit, the user can request deep dives:

- **"Drill into {module}"** — Generate detailed `06-module-details/{module}-status.md`
- **"Show me the API payloads for {feature}"** — Extract expected JSON from schema
- **"What tests are missing for {module}"** — Cross-reference with the `sdlc-documentation` skill
- **"Generate the completion plan for {phase}"** — Expand blueprint phase into tasks

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|-----------|
| Guess about features without reading code | Read actual route files and controllers |
| Mark features "complete" based on schema alone | Verify full stack: schema + API + UI + tests |
| Skip sister project analysis | Always check for API consumers/mobile apps |
| Write one massive file | Break into the defined file structure |
| Ignore test coverage | Always report testing status per module |
| Make vague recommendations | Map every action to a specific skill |

## Output Standards

- All generated files follow `doc-standards.md` (500-line max per file)
- Use tables for status mappings (scannable, not prose)
- Every gap must have: description, severity, recommended skill, complexity
- Blueprint must be dependency-ordered (no orphan tasks)
- Executive summary must fit on one screen (< 40 lines of content)
