<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- Generate Design & Development documentation for SDLC projects. Covers System Design Document (SDD), Technical Specification, Interface Control Document (ICD), Database Design Document, Code Documentation standards, and API Documentation. Use when...
- The task needs reusable judgment, domain constraints, or a proven workflow rather than ad hoc advice.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is unrelated to `sdlc-design` or would be better handled by a more specific companion skill.
- The request only needs a trivial answer and none of this skill's constraints or references materially help.

## Required Inputs

- Gather relevant project context, constraints, and the concrete problem to solve; load `templates` only as needed.
- Confirm the desired deliverable: design, code, review, migration plan, audit, or documentation.

## Workflow

- Read this `SKILL.md` first, then load only the referenced deep-dive files that are necessary for the task.
- Apply the ordered guidance, checklists, and decision rules in this skill instead of cherry-picking isolated snippets.
- Produce the deliverable with assumptions, risks, and follow-up work made explicit when they matter.

## Quality Standards

- Keep outputs execution-oriented, concise, and aligned with the repository's baseline engineering standards.
- Preserve compatibility with existing project conventions unless the skill explicitly requires a stronger standard.
- Prefer deterministic, reviewable steps over vague advice or tool-specific magic.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating examples as copy-paste truth without checking fit, constraints, or failure modes.
- Loading every reference file by default instead of using progressive disclosure.

## Outputs

- A concrete result that fits the task: implementation guidance, review findings, architecture decisions, templates, or generated artifacts.
- Clear assumptions, tradeoffs, or unresolved gaps when the task cannot be completed from available context alone.
- References used, companion skills, or follow-up actions when they materially improve execution.

## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Release evidence | System Design Document (SDD) | Markdown doc covering architecture, data, interfaces, and technical specification per ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 | `docs/sdlc/sdd-checkout.md` |

## References

- Use the `templates/` directory when the task needs a structured deliverable.
<!-- dual-compat-end -->
Generate a complete **Design & Development** documentation suite for software development projects. This skill produces 6 design documents that translate requirements (from `sdlc-planning`) into actionable technical architecture and implementation guidance.

## Load Order

1. Load `world-class-engineering`.
2. Load `system-architecture-design` and `database-design-engineering`.
3. Load this skill to turn approved requirements into executable design artifacts.

## Executable Design Standard

Design documents must define:

- critical flows, invariants, and failure handling
- release-aware architecture and migration posture
- observability, audit, and operational ownership expectations
- contract evolution rules for live systems

## When to Use

- Translating an **approved SRS** into a technical architecture and system design
- Documenting **database schemas, stored procedures, and data models** for a new system
- Specifying **API contracts** for frontend, mobile, and third-party consumers
- Defining **interface contracts** between system components and external systems
- Establishing **code documentation standards** before development begins
- Creating **technical specifications** for complex features or modules

## When NOT to Use

- **Gathering raw requirements** -- use `project-requirements` skill
- **Project-level planning** (SDP, QA Plan, Risk Plan) -- use `sdlc-planning` skill
- **Planning a single feature** (spec + implementation) -- use `feature-planning` skill
- **Writing test plans and test cases** -- use `sdlc-testing` skill
- **Writing deployment or user documentation** -- use `sdlc-user-deploy` skill
- **Planning an Android companion app** -- use `android-saas-planning` skill

## Document Inventory

| # | Document | File | Purpose | Audience | Length |
|---|----------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | System Design Document | `templates/system-design-document.md` | Overall architecture, components, interactions | Architects, senior devs, tech leads | 20-40 pages |
| 2 | Technical Specification | `templates/technical-specification.md` | Implementation details, algorithms, data structures | Developers implementing the system | 20-40 pages |
| 3 | Interface Control Document | `templates/interface-control-document.md` | Interface contracts between components/systems | Integration engineers, API consumers | 15-30 pages |
| 4 | Database Design Document | `templates/database-design-document.md` | Schema, data models, relationships, procedures | DBAs, backend developers | 20-40 pages |
| 5 | Code Documentation Standards | `templates/code-documentation-standards.md` | Inline comments, docstrings, documentation rules | All developers | 10-20 pages |
| 6 | API Documentation | `templates/api-documentation.md` | Endpoint specs, auth, errors, SDK examples | Frontend/mobile devs, integrators | 20-40 pages |

## Prerequisites

Before generating design documents, ensure these inputs exist:

| Input | Source | Required? |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Software Requirements Spec (SRS) | `sdlc-planning` skill output | Yes |
| Project Vision & Scope | `sdlc-planning` skill output | Yes |
| Tech stack decisions | Project context or defaults | Yes |
| Approved feature list with priorities | SRS or stakeholder sign-off | Yes |
| Module inventory | SRS or `modular-saas-architecture` | Recommended |
| Existing database schemas (if migrating) | Codebase audit | If applicable |
| API consumers list (mobile, web, 3rd party) | Project context | Recommended |

## Generation Workflow

Generate documents in this order. Each builds on the previous.

```
Step 1: System Design Document (architecture baseline)
    |
Step 2: Database Design Document (data layer foundation)
    |
Step 3: Technical Specification (implementation details)
    |
Step 4: Interface Control Document (component contracts)
    |
Step 5: API Documentation (consumer-facing specs)
    |
Step 6: Code Documentation Standards (team conventions)
```

**Rationale:** Architecture drives database design. Database and architecture together inform technical specs. Interface contracts are defined after components are known. API docs are consumer-facing views of interface contracts. Code standards apply across all layers.

## Architecture Patterns Supported

| Pattern | Where Used | Skill Reference |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| MVVM + Clean Architecture | Android (Presentation / Domain / Data layers) | `android-development` |
| Three-Panel Web Architecture | `/public/`, `/adminpanel/`, `/memberpanel/` | `multi-tenant-saas-architecture` |
| REST API + Dual Auth | Session (web) + JWT (mobile) | `dual-auth-rbac` |
| Row-Level Multi-Tenancy | `franchise_id` in every tenant-scoped query | `multi-tenant-saas-architecture` |
| Pluggable Module Architecture | Enable/disable business modules per tenant | `modular-saas-architecture` |
| Repository Pattern | Android data access abstraction | `android-data-persistence` |
| Service Layer Pattern | PHP business logic encapsulation | `php-modern-standards` |

## Cross-References to Existing Skills

### Upstream Skills (use BEFORE this skill)

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `sdlc-planning` | Provides SRS, Vision & Scope, SDP as inputs. Design docs implement what planning docs specify. |
| `project-requirements` | Raw requirements gathered via guided interview. Feed into SRS, then into design. |

### Parallel Skills (use ALONGSIDE this skill)

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `mysql-best-practices` | Database Design Document references these standards. Do not duplicate; cross-reference. |
| `api-error-handling` | API Documentation and Technical Spec reference error response patterns. |
| `api-pagination` | API Documentation references pagination patterns (offset-based). |
| `php-modern-standards` | Technical Spec and Code Documentation reference PHP 8+ standards. |
| `android-development` | Technical Spec references Android architecture layers (MVVM + Clean). |
| `multi-tenant-saas-architecture` | SDD references tenant isolation, three-panel architecture. |
| `dual-auth-rbac` | SDD and ICD reference dual auth flows and RBAC model. |
| `vibe-security-skill` | Security architecture sections in SDD. Always apply alongside. |

### Downstream Skills (use AFTER this skill)

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `feature-planning` | Uses design docs as input for individual feature specs and implementation plans. |
| `sdlc-testing` | Uses design docs to create test plans and test cases (future). |
| `sdlc-user-deploy` | Uses design docs for deployment guides and user manuals. |
| `saas-seeder` | Uses database design to bootstrap the SaaS template. |

## Adaptation Rules

### SaaS vs Standalone

| Aspect | Multi-Tenant SaaS | Standalone App |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| SDD scope | Three-panel architecture, tenant isolation | Single app architecture |
| Database design | `franchise_id` on all tenant tables | No tenant scoping |
| API auth | Dual auth (Session + JWT) | Single auth model |
| ICD complexity | Backend-Mobile-Web + external integrations | Fewer interface types |
| Security design | Zero-trust, audit trails, RBAC | Simpler security model |

### Mobile + Web vs Web-Only

| Aspect | Android + Web | Web-Only |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| SDD components | PHP backend + Android layers + Web frontend | PHP backend + Web frontend |
| ICD scope | REST API + internal Android layer boundaries | AJAX/fetch + internal PHP layers |
| API docs | JWT auth + session auth sections | Session auth only |
| Code docs | PHP + Kotlin + SQL standards | PHP + SQL standards |

### MVP vs Full Product

| Aspect | MVP | Full Product |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| SDD depth | Core modules only (3-5) | All modules (10-20+) |
| Database design | Core tables only | Complete schema |
| API endpoints | Authentication + core CRUD | Full endpoint inventory |
| ICD | Internal interfaces only | Internal + external integrations |

## Output Structure

When generating design documents for a project, create this structure:

```
docs/design/
├── 01-system-design-document.md
├── 01-sdd/
│   ├── component-design.md
│   ├── security-architecture.md
│   └── deployment-architecture.md
├── 02-database-design-document.md
├── 02-database/
│   ├── entity-relationship.md
│   ├── table-definitions.md
│   └── stored-procedures.md
├── 03-technical-specification.md
├── 03-tech-spec/
│   ├── module-specifications.md
│   └── algorithm-details.md
├── 04-interface-control-document.md
├── 05-api-documentation.md
├── 05-api/
│   ├── authentication-endpoints.md
│   ├── module-endpoints.md
│   └── error-reference.md
└── 06-code-documentation-standards.md
```

Each file must stay under 500 lines. Split into subdirectories as needed.

## Quality Checklist

Run after generating all documents:

- [ ] All 6 documents generated (or justified why one was skipped)
- [ ] Each document stays under 500 lines (split if needed)
- [ ] SDD references the correct tech stack with version numbers
- [ ] SDD includes ASCII architecture diagrams (system context, high-level, deployment) — visual-aid locations marked with `[DIAGRAM-PROMPT: <description>]`
- [ ] Every major design decision includes a `## Design Rationale` block: chosen approach, rejected alternatives, trade-off reasoning
- [ ] Major architectural decisions captured as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): Context → Decision → Alternatives Considered → Consequences
- [ ] Database Design references `mysql-best-practices` skill, not duplicate it
- [ ] All tenant-scoped tables include `franchise_id` column
- [ ] API Documentation references `api-error-handling` and `api-pagination` skills
- [ ] ICD covers all interface types (backend-mobile, backend-web, external)
- [ ] Technical Spec includes real PHP/Kotlin/SQL code examples in fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- [ ] Code Documentation Standards cover PHP, Kotlin, and SQL
- [ ] Security architecture addresses dual auth, RBAC, encryption, audit trails
- [ ] Deployment environments (Windows dev, Ubuntu staging, Debian prod) documented
- [ ] Rollout, migration, and rollback posture are explicit for live systems
- [ ] All documents cross-reference each other and upstream SRS
- [ ] No vague language -- all specifications are measurable and concrete
- [ ] Examples are tailored to the project's actual tech stack and domain

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Do This Instead |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Design without approved SRS | Architecture without requirements is guesswork | Complete `sdlc-planning` first |
| One massive design doc | Exceeds 500-line limit, hard to maintain | Split into 6 focused documents |
| No ASCII diagrams | Text-only architecture is hard to understand | Include system context, component, deployment diagrams — mark points needing visuals with `[DIAGRAM-PROMPT: <description>]` |
| Copy MySQL standards into DB design | Duplicates `mysql-best-practices`, goes stale | Cross-reference the skill |
| Skip tenant isolation design | Data leakage between tenants | Always document `franchise_id` strategy |
| API docs without error codes | Consumers can't handle failures | Include complete error reference table |
| No interface versioning strategy | Breaking changes cause outages | Document versioning in ICD |
| God classes in component design | Violates SRP, untestable | Define clear component boundaries |
| Design docs never updated | Docs become stale and misleading | Update at each phase gate |
| Platform-generic examples | Developers can't apply them | Use your actual tech stack in examples |
| Design decisions without rationale | Future maintainers cannot evaluate or change decisions | Add `## Design Rationale` to every key decision: state the chosen approach, rejected alternatives, and the trade-off reasoning |
| No Architecture Decision Records | Architecture history lost; audits fail | Capture each major architectural decision in a structured ADR: Context → Decision → Alternatives → Consequences |
