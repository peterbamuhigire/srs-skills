## Use When

- Generate a Software Maintenance Plan (SMP) and supporting maintenance documentation for SDLC projects. Compliant with ISO/IEC/IEEE 14764:2022. Covers Maintenance Strategy, MR/PR handling workflow, CCB process, maintenance cost estimation, and all...
- The task needs reusable judgment, domain constraints, or a proven workflow rather than ad hoc advice.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is unrelated to `sdlc-maintenance` or would be better handled by a more specific companion skill.
- The request only needs a trivial answer and none of this skill's constraints or references materially help.

## Required Inputs

- Gather relevant project context, constraints, and the concrete problem to solve.
- Confirm the desired deliverable: design, code, review, migration plan, audit, or documentation.

## Workflow

- Read this `SKILL.md` first, then load only the referenced deep-dive files that are necessary for the task.
- Apply the ordered guidance, checklists, and decision rules in this skill instead of cherry-picking isolated snippets.
- Produce the deliverable with assumptions, risks, and follow-up work made explicit when they matter.

## Quality Standards

- Keep outputs execution-oriented, concise, and aligned with the repository's baseline engineering standards.
- Preserve compatibility with existing project conventions unless the skill explicitly requires a stronger standard.
- Prefer deterministic, reviewable steps over vague advice or tool-specific magic.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating examples as copy-paste truth without checking fit, constraints, or failure modes.
- Loading every reference file by default instead of using progressive disclosure.

## Outputs

- A concrete result that fits the task: implementation guidance, review findings, architecture decisions, templates, or generated artifacts.
- Clear assumptions, tradeoffs, or unresolved gaps when the task cannot be completed from available context alone.
- References used, companion skills, or follow-up actions when they materially improve execution.

## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Operability | Software Maintenance Plan (SMP) | Markdown doc compliant with ISO/IEC/IEEE 14764 covering corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance | `docs/sdlc/smp-checkout.md` |

## References

- Use the links and companion skills already referenced in this file when deeper context is needed.
<!-- dual-compat-end -->
Generate a complete **Software Maintenance Plan (SMP)** and supporting maintenance documentation for software projects. This skill produces 3 documents that establish the maintenance baseline, define the change request workflow, and track ongoing maintenance metrics.

## Load Order

1. Load `world-class-engineering`.
2. Load `reliability-engineering`, `engineering-management-system`, and `sdlc-post-deployment`.
3. Load this skill to formalize the maintenance operating model from real production evidence.

## Executable Maintenance Standard

Maintenance documents must define:

- intake, classification, and ownership rules
- validation, rollout, and rollback expectations for maintenance changes
- maintenance metrics tied to real operational evidence
- learning loops back into planning, design, and release process

## When to Use

- Transitioning a **delivered system into the maintenance phase**
- Planning maintenance for a **live production system**
- Establishing a **Change Control Board (CCB)** and formal MR/PR workflow
- Documenting **maintenance cost estimates** for budget planning
- Complying with **ISO/IEC/IEEE 14764:2022** maintenance process requirements
- Preparing a **maintenance strategy** for a SaaS platform post-launch

## When NOT to Use

- **Planning development activities before delivery** — use `sdlc-planning` skill
- **Documenting test plans or quality gates** — use `sdlc-testing` skill
- **Creating deployment or release procedures** — use `sdlc-user-deploy` skill
- **Post-deployment health assessment** — use `sdlc-post-deployment` skill (run that first; SMP follows)

## Document Inventory

| # | Document | Purpose | Audience | Phase |
|---|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Software Maintenance Plan (SMP)** | Primary governance document: scope, org, process model, CCB, cost, training, records | Maintenance team, PM, stakeholders | Maintenance phase |
| 2 | **Change Request / Problem Report Form** | MR/PR intake template: identification, classification, impact, approval, resolution | Developers, CCB, end users | Ongoing |
| 3 | **Maintenance Metrics Report** | Periodic measurement: defect rates, MTTR, maintenance type mix, cost actuals vs. estimates | PM, stakeholders, CCB | Periodic (monthly/quarterly) |

## Standards Basis

The SMP structure is governed by **ISO/IEC/IEEE 14764:2022** (Software Engineering — Software Life Cycle Processes — Maintenance), specifically **Clause 9** (Software Maintenance Plan), which mandates 13 numbered subsections. This standard is a process standard within the **ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017** framework; Clause 6.4.13 of 12207 defines the maintenance process outcomes that the SMP must satisfy.

**Relationship to ISO 12207:** 14764 is the dedicated maintenance elaboration of 12207. When a project is governed by 12207, the SMP produced under 14764 Clause 9 fulfills the 12207 §6.4.13 process documentation requirement.

## Five Maintenance Types

ISO/IEC/IEEE 14764:2022 defines five maintenance types. Every SMP must declare which types are in scope.

| Type | Definition | Trigger |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Corrective** | Reactive modification to fix discovered faults | Bug report, system failure |
| **Adaptive** | Modification to keep the software usable in a changed environment | OS upgrade, API deprecation, regulatory change |
| **Perfective** | Modification to improve performance or maintainability | Performance complaint, code quality initiative |
| **Preventive** | Modification to detect and correct latent faults before they manifest | Code audit findings, proactive refactoring |
| **Additive** | Addition of new functionality or features after delivery *(new in 2022)* | Feature request from stakeholders |

**Empirical Distribution (Lientz & Swanson baseline):** Corrective 20% / Adaptive 25% / Perfective 50% / Preventive 5%. Use this as the planning benchmark when no project-specific history exists. Track actual mix in the Maintenance Metrics Report and adjust future estimates accordingly.

## SMP Required Sections (ISO 14764 Clause 9)

The SMP must include all 13 subsections below. Flag `[CONTEXT-GAP]` for any section where project context is absent.

**9.1.2 — Identification and control of the plan**
Document identifier, version, date, approval authority, and revision history. Links to the parent SDP and SRS.

**9.1.3 — Scope of maintenance**
Name the five maintenance types covered. State the system being maintained (name, version, deployment environment). Define the maintenance window (hours of operation, response SLAs).

**9.1.4 — Designation of maintenance organization**
Define roles: Maintenance Manager, Maintenance Engineers, Change Control Board (CCB) members, Configuration Manager, Customer Representative. Specify CCB quorum rules and escalation path.

**9.1.5 — References**
List all governing documents: SRS, SDD, STP, deployment guide, and this SMP. Include standard references: ISO/IEC/IEEE 14764:2022, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.

**9.1.6 — Definitions**
Define all maintenance-specific terms used in the plan: MR (Modification Request), PR (Problem Report), CCB, MTTR, baseline, corrective/adaptive/perfective/preventive/additive maintenance.

**9.1.7 — Processes (maintenance process model selection)**
Select and justify one of three process models:
- **Quick-Fix Model:** Fast turnaround; fix applied directly to operational code then back-ported to design docs. Risk: documentation drift. Use only for critical production fixes.
- **Iterative Enhancement Model:** Changes are analyzed, designed, implemented, and tested in mini-cycles before release. Preferred for planned maintenance.
- **Osborne's Model:** Post-delivery fixes integrated into a formal release pipeline with explicit review gates. Use when the CCB requires formal approval before any change.

**9.1.8 — Organization and maintenance activities**
Define the MR/PR 10-step workflow (see below). Assign responsible role to each step.

**9.1.9 — Resources**
List tools (version control, issue tracker, CI/CD pipeline, test environments), infrastructure, and third-party dependencies required to execute maintenance.

**9.1.10 — Estimate of maintenance costs**
Apply one or more estimation methods:
- **COCOMO II** (post-architecture model): $Effort = A \times Size^{E} \times \prod EM_i$ where effort multipliers reflect maintenance context
- **Historical data ratio:** Maintenance effort typically 40–80% of original development cost per year (Grubb & Takang, 2003)
- **Person-month estimates per maintenance type:** State assumptions explicitly; flag estimates as `[ESTIMATE-UNVERIFIED]` until actual data replaces them

**9.1.11 — Training**
Identify training required for maintenance engineers: system domain knowledge, tool proficiency, standards compliance. State who is responsible for training delivery.

**9.1.12 — Software maintenance control requirements**
Define CCB authority levels (who can approve corrective fixes vs. perfective enhancements), configuration management (CM) procedures under the SCMP, and the baseline lock/unlock protocol.

**9.1.13 — Maintenance records and reports**
Specify which records are kept: all MRs/PRs (open and closed), CCB meeting minutes, cost actuals, Maintenance Metrics Reports. State retention period and storage location.

**9.2.2 — Personnel resources**
Headcount plan: number of maintenance engineers required per maintenance type, skill profiles, and ramp-up time for new team members.

**9.2.3 — Environment resources**
Maintenance environment specification: hardware, OS, database versions, network access. Must match the production environment documented in the Deployment Guide.

**9.2.4 — Financial resources**
Annual maintenance budget broken down by maintenance type. Include contingency reserve (recommend 15–20% of total estimate).

## MR/PR 10-Step Process (ISO 14764 Clause 6.2)

Every modification — regardless of type — must follow this sequence. No step may be skipped without documented CCB waiver.

| Step | Name | Description | Owner |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | **Problem/modification identification** | MR or PR submitted with system ID, version, environment, and symptom description | Requestor |
| 2 | **Analysis** | Impact assessment: affected modules, risk level, effort estimate, classification (corrective/adaptive/perfective/preventive/additive) | Maintenance Engineer |
| 3 | **CCB review** | CCB evaluates analysis, approves, defers, or rejects the change | CCB |
| 4 | **Design** | Technical solution designed; existing design documents updated | Maintenance Engineer |
| 5 | **Implementation** | Code change developed against approved design | Developer |
| 6 | **Unit testing** | Verify the change in isolation per STP criteria | Developer |
| 7 | **Integration/regression testing** | Verify no regression; run full test suite | QA |
| 8 | **Acceptance testing** | Requestor or designated user confirms the change resolves the original MR/PR | Requestor / QA |
| 9 | **Delivery** | Change released to production via CM-controlled deployment procedure | Ops / DevOps |
| 10 | **Closure** | MR/PR record updated to Closed; lessons learned captured; documentation updated | Maintenance Manager |

## Lehman's Laws

Two of Lehman's eight laws are directly relevant to maintenance planning and serve as the theoretical justification for why an SMP is mandatory, not optional.

**Law I — Continuing Change (1974):** A program that is used must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory in use.

**Law VII — Declining Quality (1996):** The quality of an evolving system will appear to be declining unless it is rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes.

**Implication for the SMP:** These laws establish that software entropy is not accidental — it is a predictable consequence of failing to maintain. The SMP is the engineering control that counteracts both laws. An organization that delivers software without an SMP is accepting Law I and Law VII as inevitable outcomes rather than engineering risks to be managed.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Do This Instead |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| No SMP at product launch | Teams improvise; fixes are inconsistent; costs balloon | Draft SMP during final testing phase; activate at go-live |
| Treating all changes as corrective | Perfective and adaptive work goes unplanned and unbudgeted | Classify every MR/PR using the five-type taxonomy at intake |
| Quick-Fix model as the default | Documentation drifts from code; next maintainer inherits technical debt | Default to Iterative Enhancement; Quick-Fix requires documented CCB waiver |
| CCB with no quorum rules | Changes approved by a single person; no audit trail | Define minimum quorum (e.g., 3 of 5 members) in SMP §9.1.4 |
| Ignoring Lehman's Laws | Management treats maintenance as optional spend and cuts budget mid-year | Cite Law I and Law VII in the SMP business case to anchor the budget |
| Vague cost estimates with no method | Budget is arbitrary; overruns are guaranteed | Use COCOMO II or historical ratio; document all assumptions |
| No regression testing gate (Step 7) | Fixes break other features silently | Step 7 is mandatory before acceptance; reference STP for suite scope |
| Closing MRs without documentation updates | System documentation diverges from deployed code over time | Step 10 requires documentation update before closure |
