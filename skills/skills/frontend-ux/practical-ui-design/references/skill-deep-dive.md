## 2. Typography Rules

### 2.1 Typeface Selection

- **One sans-serif typeface** for the entire interface (neutral, legible, low cognitive load).
- Optionally add a **second typeface for headings only** (serif, rounded, script) to inject personality.
- Choose popular, well-tested typefaces with multiple weights and high x-height.
- When in doubt, use the platform default system font.

### 2.2 Type Scale (Major Third 1.250)

Start with **18px body** and multiply by 1.250 for each step up:

| Style | Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | 44px | Bold |
| H2 | 36px | Bold |
| H3 | 28px | Bold |
| H4 | 22px | Bold |
| Body | 18px | Regular |
| Small / Caption | 15px | Regular |

- **Body text minimum 18px** -- 14px and 16px are too small for comfortable reading.
- Complex apps/dashboards: use a smaller scale (Major Second 1.125 or Minor Third 1.200).
- Marketing sites: use a larger scale (Perfect Fifth 1.500 or Golden Ratio 1.618).
- Switch to a smaller scale on mobile to prevent excessive wrapping.

### 2.3 Font Weights

Use **Regular + Bold only**. Semi-bold is acceptable if Bold feels too heavy. Avoid light, medium, thin -- they reduce legibility at body sizes.

- **Bold** = headings (emphasis).
- **Regular** = everything else.

### 2.4 Line Height

- Body text (18px): **1.5 to 2** (start at 1.6).
- **Decrease line height as font size increases**: headings at 1.2-1.3, large display at 1.0-1.1.
- Longer lines, darker typefaces, and visually larger typefaces need taller line height.

### 2.5 Line Length

**40-80 characters per line** (66 is ideal). Do not stretch text to fill page width.

### 2.6 Alignment and Spacing

- **Left-align all text** -- consistent anchor point, optimal readability.
- Never justify body text (creates rivers of whitespace, harms dyslexic readers).
- Centre-align only very short blocks (1-2 lines max).
- **Decrease letter spacing for large text** (display sizes).
- Avoid light grey text (fails contrast) and pure black text (eye strain).

## 3. Layout and Spacing

### 3.1 The 8pt Grid

All spacing values are multiples of 8:

| Token | Value | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| **XS** | 8pt | Innermost text gaps, icon-to-label |
| **S** | 16pt | Internal component padding, gutters (mobile) |
| **M** | 24pt | Card padding, between related fields |
| **L** | 32pt | Column gaps, between field groups, nav link spacing |
| **XL** | 48pt | Section padding (small), large component gaps |
| **XXL** | 80pt | Section padding (desktop), outer margins (desktop) |

For detailed/dense interfaces, allow 4pt increments.

### 3.2 Spacing Principle: Relatedness

- More related elements = closer together.
- Start with small spacing for innermost content, gradually increase outward.
- Use the Squint Test: if you cannot distinguish groups when squinting, increase spacing.

### 3.3 Be Generous with Whitespace

- More whitespace increases comprehension by ~20%.
- When choosing between two spacing tokens, prefer the larger one.
- Tight spacing makes hierarchy and grouping invisible.

### 3.4 The 12-Column Grid

| Property | Desktop | Mobile |
|---|---|---|
| Columns | 12 (flexible %) | 4 (flexible %) |
| Gutters | 32pt (fixed) | 16pt (fixed) |
| Margins | 80pt (fixed) | 16pt (fixed) |

- Smaller elements inside containers do not need to align to the 12-column grid; use spacing tokens instead.
- Content max-width: constrain to maintain 40-80 char line length.

### 3.5 Visual Hierarchy (Priority Order)

1. **Size** -- larger = more important
2. **Colour** -- brighter, richer, warmer, higher contrast
3. **Weight** -- bolder = more important
4. **Proximity** -- surrounded by space = prominent
5. **Position** -- top or first in row = more important
6. **Depth** -- elevated (shadow) = closer to user

**Squint Test:** Blur your eyes. The most important element should still be recognisable. If not, adjust hierarchy.

### 3.6 Depth and Shadows

- Predefined shadow tokens: **Small** (sharp, subtle lift), **Medium**, **Large** (soft, high elevation).
- Light source from top (natural mental model).
- Use darkest palette variation for shadow colour, never pure black.
- White cards on grey backgrounds look elevated without any shadow.

### 3.7 Box Model

Content > Padding > Border > Margin. Spacing starts small at innermost layer and increases outward.

### 3.8 Alignment

- Left-justify content; avoid multiple alignment axes on the same screen.
- Baseline-align text of different sizes sitting on the same horizontal line.
- Border radius tokens: 8pt (small), 16pt (medium), 32pt (large).

---

## 4. Copywriting for UI

### 4.1 Conciseness

- Sentences under **20 words**.
- If a word can be removed without losing meaning, remove it.
- Cut filler: "actually", "basically", "really", "in order to", "would you like to".

### 4.2 Casing and Language

- **Sentence case everywhere** -- only first word and proper nouns capitalised.
- Plain language at a **6th-grade reading level**. Avoid jargon and slang.
- Use contractions naturally (who's, they're, you're).

### 4.3 Structure

- **Front-load** important information (key info at start of sentence/heading).
- **Inverted pyramid**: most important first, supporting info second, background last.
- Break content with **descriptive headings** and **bullet lists**.
- Headings must make sense when read out of context (screen readers extract them).

### 4.4 Numbers and Vocabulary

- Use **numerals** (245, not "two hundred and forty five"). Format with commas: 1,000.
- Very large numbers: combine numerals and words (1 billion, not 1,000,000,000).
- Consistent vocabulary throughout: pick one term and keep it (e.g. "Delete" everywhere, not "Delete" and "Remove").
- Avoid abbreviations; if used, define on first occurrence.

### 4.5 Links and Labels

- Text links must **describe their destination** ("View pricing plans", not "Click here").
- Avoid generic link text: "learn more", "read more", "click here".
- Drop "My" from form labels -- use "Email", not "My email" or "Your email".

### 4.6 Reading Patterns

- **F-pattern**: text-heavy pages (articles, search results). Users scan top, then left edge.
- **Z-pattern**: visual layouts with minimal text (landing pages, hero sections).
- **Gutenberg diagram**: evenly distributed content; primary optical area top-left, terminal area bottom-right (place CTA here).

## 5. Buttons

### 5.1 Semantics First: Button vs Link

| Element | Use For | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **`<button>`** | In-place actions that change state, submit data, open UI, confirm, or delete | Save changes, Apply filters, Delete project |
| **`<a href>`** | Navigation to another URL, route, section, file, or external destination | View pricing, Read documentation, Back to homepage |

- Never use a styled `div` or `span` as a button when a native element will do.
- Never use a `<button>` for plain navigation when an `<a href>` expresses the intent correctly.
- Users bring this mental model with them. Breaking it creates hesitation before the click.

### 5.2 Four Button Roles

| Role | Style | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary** | Solid fill (brand colour) + high-contrast text + rounded corners | Main commitment for this step |
| **Secondary** | Outlined (brand colour border + text) + rounded corners | Supporting action, cancel, back, skip |
| **Tertiary** | Text-only or ghost style | Optional or exploratory action |
| **Destructive** | Distinct danger treatment (usually red) with explicit risk language | Delete, remove, clear, cancel permanently |

- Never use a second solid-fill colour for Secondary (confuses with Primary, especially for colour-blind users).
- Never use light grey fill for Secondary (looks disabled).
- Destructive is not just a quieter Secondary. It needs its own semantic treatment.

### 5.3 Single Primary Per Decision Point

One Primary button per visible screen area or decision point. "If everything is important, nothing is important." Use Secondary for alternatives and Tertiary for lower-commitment actions.

- A form, modal, confirmation step, or card section should answer "what should I do next?" at a glance.
- If two actions feel equally primary, the flow is usually under-designed rather than under-styled.

### 5.4 Contrast, Clickability, and Sizing

- Button **shape** contrast: >= 3:1 against page background.
- Button **text** contrast: >= 4.5:1 against button fill.
- Target area: minimum **48pt x 48pt** (aligns with 8pt grid).
- Space between adjacent buttons: at least **16pt**.
- Buttons must read as pressable within half a second: visible boundary, clear containment, obvious contrast.
- Do not let buttons visually collapse into body text or card backgrounds.

### 5.5 Alignment, Labels, and Icons

- **Left-align buttons** (desktop). Most important = leftmost.
- **Mobile:** Stack top-to-bottom, most-to-least important; full-width for one-handed use.
- Button text formula: **verb + noun** ("Save changes", "Delete message", "Edit profile"). Avoid vague labels: "OK", "Submit", "Yes".
- Prefer outcome labels over mechanism labels: "Send application" beats "Submit".
- Icons are optional support, not decoration. Keep them only when they add meaning the label does not already carry.
- Avoid redundant icon + label pairs such as trash + "Delete" unless the icon aids rapid scanning in a dense UI.

### 5.6 Required States

Ship all six states for every button:

| State | Purpose | Minimum Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **Enabled** | Default actionable state | Looks interactive and readable against its background |
| **Hover** | Mouse feedback | Immediate visual response without dramatic layout shift |
| **Focus** | Keyboard visibility | High-contrast ring that is never obscured |
| **Pressed** | Instant confirmation | Clear down-state within ~100ms to prevent double-click doubt |
| **Disabled** | Temporarily unavailable | Pair with visible explanation if the reason is not obvious |
| **Loading** | Work in progress | Keep the label context: "Saving...", "Sending...", "Deleting..." |

- Do not remove the label and leave only a spinner. Users should not have to remember what they clicked.
- Hover and focus are not the same state. Keyboard users need a dedicated focus treatment.
- Dark mode button states must be designed explicitly, not auto-inverted from light mode.

### 5.7 Destructive Action Friction (Escalating)

| Level | Technique | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Initial** | Use the destructive variant and position away from Primary | Destructive "Delete" away from Primary "Save" |
| **Light** | Simple confirmation dialog | "Delete message?" / Delete message / Cancel |
| **Medium** | Red button + warning icon in dialog | "Delete article? You won't be able to recover it." |
| **Heavy** | Confirmation checkbox before action enables | "I confirm I want to delete my account" checkbox |
| **Undo** | Allow reversal after action | Toast: "Message deleted. Restore" |

### 5.8 Disabled and Unavailable Actions

- Do not pre-disable the main action with no explanation. Users can accept a constraint; they cannot accept unexplained silence.
- If an action is unavailable, make the reason explicit nearby: "Complete all required fields to continue."
- For forms, prefer enabling the submit action and validating on submit or blur instead of making users guess why nothing is available.
- For premium or permission-locked actions, show the lock state and the reason for inaccessibility.

### 5.9 Icon + Text Pairs

Match icon weight (stroke thickness) to text weight. Match icon size to text size. If mismatch is unavoidable, decrease icon contrast using the Medium colour token.

## 6. Forms (Quick Reference)

**For full depth, load the `form-ux-design` skill.**

### 6.1 Layout

- **Single column** -- consistent downward momentum, fewer missed fields.
- Stack checkboxes and radio buttons vertically.
- Exception: short related fields side by side (expiry + CVC).

### 6.2 Labels and Hints

- Labels **on top** of fields (never floating, never placeholder-as-label).
- **4pt** gap between label and its field.
- **32pt** gap between field groups.
- Hints above fields, not below (avoid being covered by autofill/keyboard).

### 6.3 Field Sizing and Input Types

- Match field width to expected input length (4-digit postcode = narrow field).
- **Radio buttons** for <= 10 options (always visible, one-click).
- **Autocomplete** for > 10 options (type-ahead, max ~10 suggestions).
- **Steppers** for small numeric adjustments (48pt min button target).
- **Toggle switch** for immediate-effect binary options; **checkbox** for submit-required binary options.

### 6.4 Validation

- **Validate on submit** -- display error summary at top of form with links to invalid fields.
- Error messages above fields (not below). Red highlight + icon.
- Never rely on colour alone for error indication.
- Exceptions for inline validation: password strength, character limits, username availability.

### 6.5 Required/Optional Marking

- Mark required fields with asterisk (*) and include instructions: "Required fields are marked with an asterisk *".
- Mark optional fields with "(optional)".
- Safest: use the word "required" on required fields.
- Minimise optional fields -- every field must earn its place.

### 6.6 Field Borders

Form field borders need at least **3:1** contrast. Applies to buttons, toggles, steppers, checkboxes, radio buttons.

---

## 7. Component Patterns (Kuleszo)

### 7.1 Search

- Text field + button labelled **"Search"** (not just an icon).
- Show recent searches on focus (reduces repeat typing).
- Autocomplete suggestions as user types; max ~10 results.
- Highlight matching characters in bold.

### 7.2 Modals

- Max width **480px**; centre on viewport.
- Clear close affordance (X button top-right + Escape key).
- Darken background overlay (trap focus inside modal).
- Single Primary action; Secondary for cancel/dismiss.
- Avoid nesting modals -- use progressive disclosure or a new screen instead.

### 7.3 Cards

- Consistent border-radius across all cards in a view.
- Shadow depth signals interactivity: deeper shadow = clickable card.
- Keep card content scannable: image + heading + 1-2 line summary + CTA.
- Ensure similar text length across cards in a row for visual alignment.

### 7.4 Navigation

- Max **7 top-level items** (Miller's Law). Group overflow under "More" or mega-menu.
- Highlight current page/section clearly (bold, underline, or brand colour indicator).
- Mobile: **bottom navigation bar** for primary actions (thumb zone); hamburger menu for secondary.
- Breadcrumbs for deep hierarchies (> 2 levels).

### 7.5 Hero Sections

- **Single CTA** (do not split attention with multiple actions).
- Max 2 sentences of supporting text.
- Ensure text contrast on background images: gradient overlay (darkest variation at 90% opacity from bottom), semi-transparent overlay (50%), blur, or solid text background.
- Place CTA in the terminal area (bottom-right per Gutenberg diagram) or directly below headline.

### 7.6 Dropdowns

- Max **7 visible options** without scrolling.
- For > 15 items: group under section headers.
- For > 30 items: switch to autocomplete/search.
- Always show a default/placeholder selection.

## 8. Dark Mode Rules

### 8.1 Not Just Inversion

Dark mode is a distinct palette, not a CSS `invert()`. Colours, contrast ratios, and shadows all need independent tuning.

### 8.2 Colour Adjustments

- **Desaturate** brand and system colours by 10-20% (saturated colours vibrate on dark backgrounds).
- Avoid pure white (#FFFFFF) text on dark backgrounds -- use Lightest token (e.g. HSB hue, 4, 80).
- Shadows are nearly invisible on dark; use **lighter borders or surface elevation** to separate layers.

### 8.3 Hierarchy Preservation

- Same size, weight, and spatial hierarchy as light mode.
- Headings remain largest and boldest; body remains Regular weight.
- Interactive elements still use Primary colour (desaturated version).

### 8.4 Independent Testing

- Test all contrast ratios against the Dark palette independently.
- APCA values change when you swap foreground/background -- re-verify.
- Test with both light and dark system preferences active.

## 9. Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Pure black (#000) backgrounds or text | Eye strain from extreme contrast | Dark grey with hue tinge |
| Multiple brand colours on interactive elements | Confuses what is clickable | Single brand colour for interactive |
| Placeholder text as label | Disappears on input, inaccessible contrast | Label above field, always visible |
| Justified body text | Rivers of whitespace, harms dyslexic readers | Left-align |
| Centre-aligned long paragraphs | Inconsistent line start, hard to scan | Left-align; centre only 1-2 lines |
| Trendy effects (glassmorphism, neumorphism) | Fail contrast, short shelf life | Clean, minimal styles |
| Multiple primary buttons per screen | Everything competing = nothing prominent | One Primary per visible area |
| Buttons used for navigation | Breaks user expectation and semantics | Use links for destination changes |
| Disabled buttons without explanation | No feedback, inaccessible | Enable + validate, or explain |
| Spinner-only loading buttons | Users lose action context | Keep verb visible: "Saving..." |
| Title Case for UI text | Harder to scan, inconsistent rules | Sentence case |
| Generic link text ("Click here") | Inaccessible, non-descriptive | Describe destination |

## 10. Design Checklist

## 11. Design Systems And Governance

### 11.1 Audit Before Reinvention

Before inventing a new pattern, check the existing product for:

- duplicated components that already solve the problem
- token drift such as one-off colors, shadows, radii, or spacing values
- states that exist in some screens but not others
- documentation that no longer matches the shipped UI

Variation is often design debt, not innovation.

### 11.2 Token Layers

Keep three layers distinct:

- primitive tokens: raw color, spacing, radius, type, elevation values
- semantic tokens: purpose-based names
- component tokens: component-scoped values and states

When page code uses raw values directly, the system usually stops scaling.

### 11.3 Component Standard

Every shared component should be explainable through:

- purpose
- anatomy
- variants
- states
- accessibility behavior
- responsive behavior
- content rules
- when to use and when not to use

If those are unclear, the component is not mature enough to standardize.

### 11.4 Source Of Truth

The product needs one obvious place where contributors can learn the current truth about tokens, components, and usage rules.
If design files, code, and docs all disagree, treat that as a quality defect.

### 11.5 Living System Rule

Design systems are not finished artifacts.
They need:

- maintenance
- contribution rules
- adoption checks
- cleanup of duplicates and dead variants

Before shipping any screen, verify:

- [ ] HSB-based colour palette created (light + dark variants)
- [ ] WCAG contrast verified: 4.5:1 small text, 3:1 large text + UI components
- [ ] System colours (red/amber/green/blue) paired with icons, not colour alone
- [ ] Type scale applied (Major Third or project-appropriate scale)
- [ ] Body text >= 18px; line height 1.5-2 for body
- [ ] Line length 40-80 characters
- [ ] 8pt spacing grid used consistently (XS through XXL tokens)
- [ ] 12-column grid for page layout (32pt gutters desktop, 16pt mobile)
- [ ] Single Primary button per visible screen area
- [ ] All touch targets >= 48pt; >= 16pt between buttons
- [ ] Sentence case for all UI text
- [ ] Button text = verb + noun
- [ ] Buttons trigger actions; links handle navigation
- [ ] All six button states designed: enabled, hover, focus, pressed, disabled, loading
- [ ] Disabled or locked actions explain why they are unavailable
- [ ] Links describe their destination
- [ ] Forms: single column, labels on top, validate on submit
- [ ] Squint test passes (hierarchy clear when blurred)
- [ ] Dark mode palette tested independently for contrast
- [ ] No pure black or pure white in palette
- [ ] Destructive actions use appropriate friction level
