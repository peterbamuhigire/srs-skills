## Use When

- Comprehensive UI/UX quality audit covering visual hierarchy, accessibility, AI slop detection, typography, colour, layout, interaction states, responsive behaviour, performance, and microcopy. Produces severity-rated findings with actionable...
- The task needs reusable judgment, domain constraints, or a proven workflow rather than ad hoc advice.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is unrelated to `design-audit` or would be better handled by a more specific companion skill.
- The request only needs a trivial answer and none of this skill's constraints or references materially help.

## Required Inputs

- Gather relevant project context, constraints, and the concrete problem to solve.
- Confirm the desired deliverable: design, code, review, migration plan, audit, or documentation.

## Workflow

- Read this `SKILL.md` first, then load only the referenced deep-dive files that are necessary for the task.
- Apply the ordered guidance, checklists, and decision rules in this skill instead of cherry-picking isolated snippets.
- Produce the deliverable with assumptions, risks, and follow-up work made explicit when they matter.
- For premium products, add a premium-readiness pass: buyer proof, service cues, pricing confidence, executive clarity, support visibility, SEO/content authority, and product packaging.

## Quality Standards

- Keep outputs execution-oriented, concise, and aligned with the repository's baseline engineering standards.
- Preserve compatibility with existing project conventions unless the skill explicitly requires a stronger standard.
- Prefer deterministic, reviewable steps over vague advice or tool-specific magic.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating examples as copy-paste truth without checking fit, constraints, or failure modes.
- Loading every reference file by default instead of using progressive disclosure.

## Outputs

- A concrete result that fits the task: implementation guidance, review findings, architecture decisions, templates, or generated artifacts.
- Clear assumptions, tradeoffs, or unresolved gaps when the task cannot be completed from available context alone.
- References used, companion skills, or follow-up actions when they materially improve execution.

## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| UX quality | Design audit report | Markdown doc covering visual hierarchy, typography, spacing, colour, and accessibility findings | `docs/ux/design-audit-checkout.md` |
| UX quality | Accessibility pass report | Markdown doc summarising WCAG conformance | `docs/ux/a11y-checkout.md` |

## References

- Use the links and companion skills already referenced in this file when deeper context is needed.
- Use `references/consistency-audit.md` when drift between screens, components, or labels is a suspected issue.

## 1. Audit Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Before auditing, understand:

- **Who are the users?** (age, tech literacy, use context)
- **What's the purpose?** (task completion, information display, commerce)
- **What platform?** (web, Android, iOS, cross-platform)
- **What design system?** (if any — tokens, components, patterns)
- **What's the brand personality?** (professional, playful, clinical)

### Step 2: Systematic Scan

Evaluate across all 10 dimensions (Section 2). Score each dimension.

### Step 3: Produce Report

Follow the report structure (Section 3). Prioritise findings by severity.

## 2. The 10 Audit Dimensions

### Dimension 1: AI Slop Detection

**The first check.** Does this interface look machine-generated?

| Check | Look For |
|---|---|
| Typography | Inter/Roboto defaults, no hierarchy, title case everywhere |
| Colour | Cyan-on-dark, purple gradients, gradient text, pure black/white |
| Layout | Everything in cards, identical card grids, everything centred |
| Effects | Glassmorphism, decorative blur, glow borders, SVG blobs |
| Motion | Bounce/elastic easing, animation fatigue |
| Content | "Submit" buttons, "Loading..." text, corporate AI jargon |

**Verdict**: PASS (distinctive, intentional) / BORDERLINE (some generic choices) / FAIL (immediately recognisable as AI-generated)

Premium audit red flags include generic screenshots, unsupported premium claims, vague pricing CTAs, weak empty states, no proof, no support path, no business outcome, and polish that is not backed by speed, accessibility, data quality, or controls.

### Dimension 2: Visual Hierarchy

| Check | Standard |
|---|---|
| Squint test | Most important element visible when blurred |
| Size hierarchy | Clear primary > secondary > tertiary sizing |
| Weight contrast | Bold for headings, regular for body (not medium/light) |
| Colour emphasis | Brand colour reserved for interactive elements |
| Whitespace | Generous spacing separates sections; tight spacing groups related items |
| Focal point | Each screen has one clear entry point for the eye |

### Dimension 3: Accessibility

| Check | Standard | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Text contrast | >= 4.5:1 (body), >= 3:1 (large text) | Critical |
| UI component contrast | >= 3:1 against background | Critical |
| Touch targets | >= 44x44px (48x48px preferred) | Critical |
| Keyboard navigation | Logical tab order, visible focus ring | Critical |
| Screen reader | Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, meaningful alt text | Critical |
| Colour independence | Never colour alone as indicator | High |
| Zoom support | Usable at 200% zoom | High |
| Reduced motion | `prefers-reduced-motion` respected | High |
| Focus management | Focus moves logically after interactions | Medium |

### Dimension 4: Typography

| Check | Standard |
|---|---|
| Font choice | Intentional, not default (matches brand personality) |
| Type scale | Consistent scale (Major Third or project-appropriate) |
| Body size | >= 16px (18px preferred) |
| Line height | 1.5-2.0 for body; decreasing for larger sizes |
| Line length | 40-80 characters (66 ideal) |
| Weight usage | Regular + Bold only (avoid thin/light/medium) |
| Alignment | Left-aligned body text (no justified, centre only for 1-2 lines) |
| Letter spacing | Decreased for large display text |

### Dimension 5: Colour

| Check | Standard |
|---|---|
| Tinted neutrals | No pure grey (#808080), black (#000), or white (#fff) |
| Palette structure | Primary + neutral + semantic + surface tokens |
| 60-30-10 rule | 60% neutral, 30% secondary, 10% accent |
| Semantic colour | Red=error, amber=warning, green=success, blue=info |
| Dark mode | Independently designed (not inverted), desaturated brand colours |
| Brand colour usage | Reserved for interactive elements only |
| System colour pairing | Always paired with icon (not colour alone) |

### Dimension 6: Layout & Spacing

| Check | Standard |
|---|---|
| Spacing system | Consistent token scale (4pt or 8pt based) |
| Spacing variation | Rhythm through varied spacing (not uniform everywhere) |
| Alignment consistency | Few alignment axes per screen |
| Content max-width | Text constrained to 40-80 character line length |
| Grid usage | Appropriate tool: Flexbox for 1D, Grid for 2D |
| Responsive | Mobile-first, content-driven breakpoints |
| Container queries | Used for reusable components |

### Dimension 7: Interaction States

Every interactive element must have these states defined:

| State | Visual Treatment |
|---|---|
| Default | Base appearance |
| Hover | Subtle shift (colour, shadow, or position) |
| Focus | Visible ring (`focus-visible` for keyboard only) |
| Active/Pressed | Distinct from hover (scale or colour change) |
| Disabled | Reduced opacity OR removed with explanation |
| Loading | Inline indicator with specific status text |
| Error | Red styling + icon + descriptive message |
| Success | Green styling + icon + confirmation message |

### Dimension 8: Motion & Animation

| Check | Standard |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Every animation serves a function (feedback, guide, connect) |
| Timing | Follows 100/300/500 rule for category |
| Easing | Exponential curves (ease-out-quart/quint), no bounce/elastic |
| GPU-only | Transform + opacity only (no layout property animation) |
| Reduced motion | `prefers-reduced-motion` alternative provided |
| Performance | 60fps on mid-range devices |
| Restraint | Not everything animates (no animation fatigue) |

### Dimension 9: Content & Microcopy

| Check | Standard |
|---|---|
| Button labels | Verb + noun (no "Submit", "OK", "Yes/No") |
| Error messages | What happened + why + how to fix |
| Empty states | Acknowledge + explain value + action |
| Loading text | Names the operation ("Saving your draft...") |
| Link text | Descriptive (no "Click here", "Learn more") |
| Vocabulary | Consistent terms throughout |
| Tone | Matches moment (serious for errors, warm for onboarding) |

### Dimension 10: Performance

| Check | Standard |
|---|---|
| LCP | < 2.5s on mid-range mobile |
| INP | < 200ms |
| CLS | < 0.1 |
| Initial load | < 650 KB compressed total |
| Images | WebP/AVIF, srcset, lazy loading, explicit dimensions |
| Fonts | `font-display: swap`, preloaded, subset |
