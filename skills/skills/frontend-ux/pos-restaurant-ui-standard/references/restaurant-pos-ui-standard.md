## PNG Icon Standard (Mandatory — Applies to All Menus)

**All navigation menu items MUST use `<img>` PNG tags. Bootstrap Icon (`<i class="bi bi-...">`) tags are FORBIDDEN in menus.**

See the full PNG Icon Standard in `webapp-gui-design` skill, section 03 (Architecture, Panels, Menus).

**After any menu change:**
1. Scan all menu include files for `<img src="...icons/` references
2. Check which PNG files exist in the icons folder
3. Report every missing PNG to the developer before finishing — present the table of required filenames, use-context, and size

## Standard Layout Summary

- Three-column desktop: context, menu, cart
- Two-column tablet: menu + cart
- Single-column mobile: stacked menu with floating cart bar
- Sticky context header
- Search-first workflow with auto-focus
- Quick access lanes (Recent, Favorites, Popular)
- Menu grid with quick add (+1, +2) and optional customize
- Cart panel always visible and Pay CTA dominant
