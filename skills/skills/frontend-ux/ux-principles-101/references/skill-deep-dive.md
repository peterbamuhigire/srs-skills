## 2. Controls & Buttons

Source: Grant Ch.6-15

- **Ellipsis (...)** in a button label means "further step required before action"
- Buttons must **look like buttons** — flat text is not a button; add affordances
- The **entire button area** is clickable, not just the label text
- Show pointer cursor on hover (desktop); give visual click feedback
- Don't invent arbitrary controls — use platform-standard components
- **Search** = text field + button labelled "Search"; magnifying glass icon only for search
- **Sliders** for subjective/qualitative values only (volume, brightness) — never for precise numbers
- **Numeric fields** (`<input type="number">`) for exact integer entry
- **Dropdowns** for >5 options; **radio buttons** for 2-5 options
- Group buttons by function; size per Fitts' Law (big enough to hit, spaced to avoid mis-clicks)
- Always allow **undo** for destructive actions (toast + undo control, grace period)

## 3. Forms & Input

Source: Grant Ch.34-54

### Password & Auth

- Default obfuscated; **show/hide toggle mandatory**
- Always allow **paste** into password fields (supports password managers)
- Don't require typing password twice — use the toggle instead
- Show strength rules while user types
- Pre-fill username in **"Forgot Password"** if already attempted sign-in
- **Case-insensitive** for usernames and emails; case-sensitive for passwords only

### Validation

- Validate **on blur** (per-field), not on submit
- Show **which field** needs attention (highlight + inline message)
- Never show only a generic "there was an error" banner
- Suggest corrections for common mistakes ("Did you mean gmail.com?")
- **Never clear** user-entered data on error or page reload

### Input Flexibility

- Accept spaces, dashes, brackets in phone numbers — parse server-side
- Allow hyphens, apostrophes, special characters in names
- Accept varied postal code formats; offer live lookup if possible
- Don't add decimal places to currency fields — let the user type them
- Match field width to expected content length
- Use device-native input: `type="tel"`, `type="email"`, system date pickers

### Email

- No client-side regex validation (too many false rejections with 1000+ TLDs)
- Use `<input type="email">` and verify server-side with a one-click link

### Payment Cards

- Bare minimum: card number, expiry, CVC — nothing else
- One field for full card number; silently strip spaces
- **HTTPS only** for card collection — no exceptions
- Always confirm the amount back to the user before charging

### Image Uploads

- Offer file picker **and** camera capture
- Allow multiple uploads in one action
- Provide crop and rotate; accept JPEG, PNG, GIF minimum
- Show upload progress

### General Form Rules

- Don't ask for more than you need — every extra field reduces conversion
- Explain why you collect data and how you use it
- Use the same date picker control consistently across the product
- Don't move the UI while the user is interacting (reserve space for async elements)

## 4. Navigation & Content

Source: Grant Ch.16-27, 83-84, 92-98

### Scroll & Pagination

- **Infinite scroll** for feed-style content only (news, photos)
- **Pagination** for finite/structured content (emails, orders, search results)
- Store user's **scroll position** on navigate-away; restore on return
- Show edges of off-screen items as visual cues that more content exists

### Menus & Discoverability

- Don't hide items in **hamburger menus** — kills discoverability and orientation
- If hamburger is unavoidable, label it "Menu"
- Prefer bottom nav, tabbed nav, or visible sidebar
- Group menu items into sections (Miller's Law: 7 plus-or-minus 2)
- Hide **advanced settings** behind progressive disclosure
- Repeat key nav items in the **footer**; don't make footer a dead end

### Links

- Links must **look like links** (underlined or clearly distinct)
- Don't make non-links look clickable

### Content Patterns

- "Show, don't tell" — on-screen tips beat long text descriptions
- Users don't read; they scan — use visual hierarchy
- Video demos great for complex features; must be skippable
- Build on **established metaphors** (Jakob's Law) — users want your product to work like others they know
- Pick good **defaults** — most users never change them
- Decide: is this interaction **obvious** (always visible), **easy** (findable), or **possible** (tucked away)?
- Follow standard **messaging** patterns: unread count, grouped inbox, thread view, "return" for new line not send

---

## 5. Search UX

Source: Grant Ch.11, 82, 91

- Search field = text input + button labelled "Search"
- Auto-focus search field when Search tab is tapped (mobile)
- **Categorise** results into sections (products, pages, help articles) with counts
- Most relevant result at **top** — don't promote paid results over organic
- Handle **zero results** gracefully: spelling suggestions, related queries, guidance
- Provide sort and filter controls for large result sets
- Test popular search terms to verify relevance
- For dropdowns with many options, add a **search/filter** inside the dropdown

---

## 6. Empty States & Onboarding

Source: Grant Ch.20-21, 74, 77-78, 80; Maioli SSI

### Blank Slates

- Empty views must show **helpful content + CTA** (not just "No items")
- Be task-oriented: tell users what to do next, be specific per feature
- Blank slates display once — ideal moment for orientation

### Three System States to Design For (Maioli — System State Inventory)

1. **New user (empty):** Guided content, sample data, getting-started tips
2. **Typical use:** The standard UI with real data
3. **Extreme/overloaded:** Graceful handling of large data sets, edge cases

### Onboarding Rules

- "Getting Started" tips must be **easily dismissable** in one action
- If your UI requires extensive explanation, simplify the UI instead
- Don't nag users to **rate the app** — include a quiet link for motivated users
- Don't use **vanity splash screens** — show a layout skeleton instead
- Users don't care about your company's mission statement — show value immediately

### Returning Users

- **"Create from Existing"** shortcut: duplicate + edit beats starting from scratch
- Respect prior context — pre-fill, remember preferences, restore state

## 7. Progress & Feedback

Source: Grant Ch.55-58

| Task type | Indicator | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Determinate (known duration) | **Linear progress bar** | Single bar, clear start/end, never sequential sub-bars |
| Indeterminate (unknown duration) | **Spinner** | Animated to show activity; remove on error |
| Never | Looping animated progress bar | Filling to 100% then restarting is dishonest |

- Show **numeric progress** (percentage or "3 of 7") if there is time to read it
- For long processes, show estimated **time remaining** (or % if estimate unreliable)
- Provide feedback within **400ms** (Doherty Threshold from Laws of UX)
- Keep micro-animations short and subtle; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

---

## 8. Error Recovery

Source: Grant Ch.15, 45-47; Maioli severity scale

### Validation Flow

1. Validate **on blur** (per-field) with inline messages
2. Summarise remaining errors **on submit**
3. Highlight the specific field + show constructive message
4. Never clear form data on validation failure

### Error Message Rules

- Clear, simple, constructive — never intimidating or blame-the-user
- Tell user **what went wrong** and **how to fix it**
- Use active voice ("Enter a valid email" not "Email is invalid")

### Destructive Actions

- **Undo** for reversible destructive actions (toast + undo control, grace period)
- **Confirmation dialog** for irreversible actions ("Delete account?")
- Always provide an escape hatch — user control and freedom

### Nielsen Severity Scale (Maioli)

| Rating | Severity | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Not a usability problem | No action |
| 1 | Cosmetic | Fix when convenient |
| 2 | Minor | Low priority fix |
| 3 | Major | High priority — fix before next release |
| 4 | Catastrophe | **Must fix before release** |

## 9. User Journeys

Source: Grant Ch.70-81

- Every journey has a **beginning, middle, and end** — signpost each stage
- User always knows their **current stage** (progress indicator, breadcrumbs, landmarks)
- **Breadcrumb navigation** for deep hierarchies — well-understood, rarely misused
- **"Skip This"** for optional steps — never trap users in non-essential flows
- Show **unsaved work indicator** (bullet, "not saved" text in title bar)
- Consider autosave where appropriate
- Follow **standard e-commerce** pattern: products (searchable, sortable, add-to-cart) > basket (modify, remove) > checkout (details, payment, guest option)
- Make it **easy to pay** — simple pricing page, obvious buy buttons, minimal form
- Test payment flows regularly
- Make your **favicon** distinctive and legible at 16px
- Don't build custom back buttons that replicate browser behaviour

## 10. Copywriting for UI

Source: Grant Ch.85-90

### Standard Terminology

| Use this | Not this |
|---|---|
| Sign in | Log in, logon |
| Sign out | Log out, logoff |
| Sign up | Register |
| Forgot password | Reset your password, Can't access your account |

### Writing Rules

- **Consistent terminology** — same action = same word everywhere ("cart" not "cart/basket/bag")
- Write **like a human** — "Edit customer details" not "Edit customer"
- **Active voice** over passive: "Restart your computer to apply updates" not "Your computer must be restarted"
- User-centric language, never developer-centric or corporate-speak
- Don't let brand voice override clarity
- Continually review copy; test phrases with real users

---

## 11. Ethical Design

Source: Grant Ch.99-101; Maioli dark patterns

### Dark Patterns to Explicitly Avoid

- Sneaked items in cart (insurance, warranties auto-added)
- Promoted/fake results disguised as organic search results
- Ads that look like content or navigation
- Silently changing privacy settings or pre-checking marketing opt-ins
- Confusing unsubscribe flows (multiple steps, guilt-tripping copy)
- Full-screen "rate this app" nag dialogs
- Addictive design patterns that exploit psychological vulnerabilities

### Testing Imperative

- Test with **5 real users** — finds **85%** of usability problems (NNG Poisson distribution)
- Test with diverse ages, genders, abilities, and technical experience
- Test early (even paper prototypes); test often
- Users won't tell you what is wrong — they will just leave
- Don't test with colleagues or your boss — they are not real users

### Brand vs UX

- Nobody cares about your brand — they care what your product lets them do
- The UX **is** the brand; fight for the user, not the brand guide
- Reject brand guidelines that break: contrast, readability, usability, or accessibility

## 12. Heuristic Evaluation Quick Reference

Source: Maioli Ch.2 — Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

1. **Visibility of system status** — keep users informed with timely feedback
2. **Match between system and real world** — use familiar language and conventions
3. **User control and freedom** — undo, redo, emergency exits
4. **Consistency and standards** — same words, actions, situations mean the same thing
5. **Error prevention** — eliminate error-prone conditions; confirm before destructive actions
6. **Recognition rather than recall** — make options visible; minimise memory load
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use** — accelerators for experts, simple paths for novices
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design** — every extra unit of information competes with relevant info
9. **Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors** — plain language, suggest solution
10. **Help and documentation** — easy to search, focused on user tasks, concise

### Conversion Statistics (Maioli)

- Average e-commerce conversion rate: **2-3%**
- Every friction point compounds abandonment
- Fixing the top severity-4 issues yields the largest conversion gains

## Typography Quick Reference

Source: Grant Ch.1-5

- Max **two typefaces**: one for headings, one for body
- Prefer the **system font stack** for body copy (faster, renders better)
- Body copy: **16px**, **1.5 line height**, default character spacing
- Use **2-3 type sizes** to depict information hierarchy (headline > subtitle > body)
- Never disable device text scaling
