## Use When

- Designing or reviewing a website, SaaS app, dashboard, Android app, or iOS app where perceived quality, trust, usability, and commercial value matter.
- A product must feel premium, beautiful, calm, efficient, and worth paying serious money for.
- Existing UI work looks generic, cluttered, one-note, hard to scan, or visually cheap.
- Creating a design system, visual QA report, UX specification, or screen-by-screen implementation plan.
- Writing or reviewing an SRS, acceptance criteria, traceability matrix, or design handoff requirements where premium UI/UX must be specified as testable, non-taste-based requirements.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is copy-only, backend-only, or not user-facing.
- A platform-specific companion skill owns the implementation detail and already loaded this premium layer.

## Required Inputs

- Product goal, target users, business model, brand position, platform, and primary user tasks.
- Existing screenshots, designs, or product screens when available.
- Domain constraints: data density, performance budget, accessibility needs, device classes, and revenue-critical flows.

## Workflow

1. Define the business promise: what the user must understand, trust, and accomplish quickly.
2. Choose a visual voice: restrained enterprise, editorial premium, operational dense, consumer polished, luxury minimal, or another defensible direction.
3. Build hierarchy before style: one primary action, obvious navigation, clear content priority, and explicit next steps.
4. Create a tokenized visual system: color, type, spacing, radius, elevation, motion, icons, charts, and image treatment.
5. Design every state: loading, empty, error, success, disabled, offline, slow network, permissions denied, and destructive confirmation.
6. Apply platform conventions: web, Android, and iOS must feel native to their medium, not like resized versions of one another.
7. Run the premium UI/UX gate before calling the work done.
8. Produce evidence: screenshots, score, defects, and concrete improvements.
9. When operating in SRS mode, translate the above into testable non-functional requirements linked to SRS IDs and verification methods (see `premium-ui-ux-specification-rules.md`).

## Quality Standards

- Beauty must serve comprehension, trust, efficiency, and conversion. Decoration that does not improve these outcomes is removed.
- The interface has a clear visual path. Size, weight, color, spacing, placement, and grouping agree about what matters.
- Color has a job: brand recognition, hierarchy, grouping, status, warning, emotion, or navigation. It is never random garnish.
- Text remains readable at all breakpoints and in dark/light modes. Contrast, line length, line height, and hierarchy are verified.
- Dashboards and charts prioritize perceptual accuracy, direct labels, context, comparisons, and actionability.
- Mobile UI uses platform-native ergonomics, navigation, gestures, touch targets, accessibility, and motion expectations.
- Implementation must be production-ready: responsive, fast, accessible, documented, tokenized, and screenshot-verified.

## Anti-Patterns

- Generic AI aesthetic: oversized cards, vague gradients, decorative blobs, one-color palettes, weak typography, and stock-like imagery.
- Pretty but slow, inaccessible, or hard to use.
- Dashboard decoration: gauges, 3D effects, unnecessary shadows, loud colors, disconnected legends, and chart junk.
- Native apps that look like squeezed websites.
- Design systems that define colors and fonts but omit component states, usage rules, ownership, and quality gates.

## Outputs

- Premium UI/UX brief, visual direction, token plan, component/pattern guidance, dashboard guidance, mobile guidance, or review findings.
- A premium UI/UX score with specific remediation items when reviewing finished work.
- Source notes for any book-derived reasoning used in the decision.
