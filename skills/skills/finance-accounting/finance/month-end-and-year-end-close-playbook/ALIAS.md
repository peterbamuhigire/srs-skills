# Month-End and Year-End Close Playbook

## Overview

Close is a controlled workflow, not a calendar reminder. Each close task has owner, due date, dependency, evidence, review state, exception state, and release decision. Close ends with a documented release state: `pass`, `pass-with-caveats`, or `fail`. Year-end close adds retained-earnings close, lock-period procedure, reopen governance, audit-request tracking, and a final report freeze.

## Year-end specifics

- Retained-earnings close: close all 4xxx–9xxx accounts into 3300 Current-Year Profit/Loss; sweep 3300 to 3200 Retained Earnings at year-end.
- Lock-period procedure: after sign-off and audit window, lock all months of the financial year.
- Reopen governance: reopen requires Controller + CFO approval, time-boxed, audit-logged.
- Audit-request tracking: every auditor request logged with respondent, evidence, status, due date.
- Final report freeze: financial statements signed by directors; subsequent corrections become prior-period adjustments under Section 10 / IAS 8.

## Period-state transitions

| From | To | Permitted by |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | `soft-closed` | Controller |
| `soft-closed` | `open` | Controller (with reason) |
| `soft-closed` | `locked` | Controller |
| `locked` | `reopened` | Controller + CFO |
| `reopened` | `locked` | Controller |
| `locked` | `archived` | Controller (after audit window) |

## Release states

- `pass` — no blockers; all checks complete; all reconciliations matched; reviewer sign-off recorded.
- `pass-with-caveats` — no blockers; named items carry forward (e.g. tax provision pending tax-reviewer sign-off) with assigned owner and target date.
- `fail` — blocker(s) remain; close not released.

## Acceptance evidence

| Evidence | Description |
|---|---|
| Close-task register | Every task with owner, due, status, evidence path. |
| Reconciliation evidence packs | Per `bank-and-mobile-money-reconciliation`. |
| Adjustment journal listing | All accruals, depreciation, FX revaluation, provisions, write-downs. |
| Subledger tie-out summary | Control account vs subledger reconciliation by account. |
| Reports pack | All reports per "Reports" task list, with print stylesheet applied. |
| Reviewer sign-off | In the audit log: preparer, reviewer, time stamps. |
| Gate manifest | State, blockers, caveats, evidence-pack path. |

## Forbidden patterns

- Closing a period without subledger tie-out.
- Posting to a locked period via a back door.
- Sign-off without reviewer identity in the audit log.
- Close report missing a print stylesheet.
- Reopen without Controller + CFO approval.
