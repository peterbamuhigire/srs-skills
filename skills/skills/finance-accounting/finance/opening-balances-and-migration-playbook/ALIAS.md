# Opening Balances and Migration Playbook

## Overview

Migration must not preserve bad architecture. The cutover converts legacy data into the new accounting model with explicit mapping, tie-outs, and reviewer sign-off. Trial-balance-only migration is **not** sufficient where open subledgers exist.

## Required first reads

- `doctrine/accounting-finance-doctrine.md`
- `doctrine/references/chart-of-accounts.md`
- `doctrine/references/ledger-invariants.md`
- `doctrine/references/required-patterns.md`
- `doctrine/references/forbidden-patterns.md` (migration section)
- This skill's `references/cutover-pack.md`.

## Conversion-date model

A single named conversion date per entity. All balances are at end-of-business on the conversion date. Operational postings before the conversion date live in the legacy system; postings from the day after live in Chwezi. The conversion-date journal is the opening journal.

## Cutover pack (mandatory contents)

| # | Item |
|---|---|
| 1 | Named conversion date and effective time zone. |
| 2 | Legacy trial balance: legacy account, balance, currency, mapped Chwezi account. |
| 3 | Legacy chart-of-accounts to Chwezi CoA mapping (every legacy account either mapped or routed to Migration Suspense with reason). |
| 4 | Opening journal in Chwezi: balanced; per currency; per book. |
| 5 | AR open items: customer, invoice, date, amount, currency, ageing bucket, document reference. Tied to AR control account. |
| 6 | AP open items: supplier, bill, date, amount, currency, ageing bucket, document reference. Tied to AP control account. |
| 7 | Inventory: SKU, location, quantity, unit cost, valuation method (FIFO / weighted average — never LIFO), total value. Tied to Inventory control accounts. |
| 8 | Fixed assets: asset, class, acquisition date, cost, accumulated depreciation, useful life, depreciation method, residual value, location, custodian. Tied to FA cost and accumulated-depreciation accounts. |
| 9 | Bank balances: account, currency, balance, latest reconciled date, reconciliation evidence. |
| 10 | Mobile-money balances: provider, account, balance, reconciliation evidence. |
| 11 | Cash on Hand / petty cash: location, count, custodian, evidence. |
| 12 | Card / mobile-money settlement clearing balances at cutover. |
| 13 | Payroll liabilities: PAYE, NSSF, WHT, salaries payable, by employee schedule. |
| 14 | Tax liabilities: Output VAT, Input VAT, WHT, income tax payable, by tax-code schedule. |
| 15 | Borrowings: lender, principal outstanding, accrued interest, repayment schedule, security. |
| 16 | Provisions: nature, opening balance, basis, expected timing. |
| 17 | Equity: share capital, share premium, retained earnings, other reserves. |
| 18 | Migration suspense account: must reach zero or be formally waived with sign-off. |
| 19 | Source-evidence index: every figure traceable to a legacy source. |
| 20 | Preparer, reviewer, approver names, roles, sign-offs, timestamps. |

## Workflow

1. **Scope and freeze.** Confirm entities, books, currencies, sectors, integrations, and roles. Freeze legacy data at conversion date.
2. **Map.** CoA mapping; product / SKU mapping; customer / supplier mapping; tax code mapping.
3. **Extract.** Pull legacy trial balance and subledger detail.
4. **Stage.** Import into Chwezi staging; do not post yet.
5. **Tie-out.** Each subledger reconciled to its control balance; variances surfaced.
6. **Suspense.** Unmapped or unresolved balances routed to Migration Suspense with ageing and owner.
7. **Post opening journal.** Through the posting service, balanced by currency, dimensions applied, period state = opening (a special state preceding `open`).
8. **Sign off.** Preparer, reviewer, approver — typically Accountant + Controller + CFO / finance lead.
9. **Go-live.** Period state moves to `open` at the day after conversion. The opening journal is immutable.
10. **Post-cutover review.** First-close governance is enhanced for the first three months.

Suspense: 0  (waiver: not required)

## Migration suspense

Migration Suspense (CoA 1990) is a cutover-only clearing. It accepts items that cannot be mapped at cutover. Each suspense item carries:

- Description
- Legacy reference
- Amount
- Ageing target (default: cleared within 30 days of go-live)
- Owner
- Resolution plan
- Status

A non-zero suspense at sign-off requires a formal waiver: scope, value, plan, due date, approver.

## Tie-outs (mandatory)

| Tie-out | Source A | Source B | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| AR | AR control account balance | AR subledger open-item sum | Equal to the cent. |
| AP | AP control account balance | AP subledger open-item sum | Equal. |
| Inventory by location | Inventory control account | Inventory subledger sum | Equal per location. |
| Fixed Assets | FA cost - Accumulated depreciation control | Asset register sum | Equal. |
| Bank | Bank GL closing | Bank statement closing | Equal as at conversion date. |
| Mobile money | MoMo GL closing | Provider statement closing | Equal. |
| Cash on Hand | Cash GL | Physical count | Equal. |
| Payroll liabilities | Payroll GL controls | Payroll schedule sum by liability | Equal. |
| Tax control accounts | Tax GL | Tax-return schedules | Equal. |

## Sign-off

Preparer (Accountant) + Reviewer (Controller) + Approver (CFO / finance lead) — recorded in the audit log with timestamps and role context. Approval also includes confirmation that:

- LIFO is not the inventory valuation method.
- Tax-control balances are tied to verifiable schedules.
- Suspense is zero or waiver is documented.
- Conversion date is recorded.

## Acceptance evidence

- Cutover pack (per content list above).
- Tie-out reports.
- Opening journal posted and locked.
- Sign-off audit-log entries.
- Gate manifest state: `pass` or `pass-with-caveats` if suspense is waived.

## Forbidden patterns

- Trial-balance-only migration where open subledgers exist (blocker).
- LIFO inventory in opening balances under IFRS / IFRS for SMEs (blocker).
- Hardcoded statutory liability balances copied from legacy without tie-out (blocker).
- Suspense waived without sign-off (blocker).
- Posting opening journal outside the posting service (blocker).
