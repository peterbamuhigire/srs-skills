Defines the minimum reports, their content, the drilldown chain, the auditor-export index, the print fidelity, the sign-off, and the release governance.

# Audit-Ready Reporting Pack

## Overview

Every entity in scope produces a release-grade reporting pack at month-end and an enhanced pack at year-end. The pack supports management decision-making, statutory filing, and external audit. Every figure is drillable to its source; every page prints correctly; every release carries reviewer sign-off.

## Drilldown chain

Every figure on every report is drillable. The chain is consistent:

```
Report line → CoA account → Journal → Journal line → Source document → Evidence file → Audit-log entry
```

The drilldown affordance is mandatory on web and mobile, and the PDF / printed report contains a section ID enabling cross-reference into the auditor export.

## Auditor export index

The auditor export is a single bundle:

```
audit-export-<entity>-<YYYY-MM>/
├── 00-index.md
├── 01-trial-balance.csv
├── 02-gl-detail.csv
├── 03-journal-listing.csv
├── 04-financial-statements.pdf
├── 05-ar-detail/
├── 06-ap-detail/
├── 07-inventory/
├── 08-fixed-assets/
├── 09-payroll/
├── 10-reconciliations/
│   ├── bank/
│   ├── mobile-money/
│   ├── pos/
│   └── card/
├── 11-tax/
│   ├── vat/
│   ├── paye/
│   ├── wht/
│   ├── nssf/
│   └── income-tax/
├── 12-management-accounts.pdf
├── 13-donor-grants/
├── 14-source-documents/         # PDFs, images, structured files
├── 15-audit-log.csv
└── manifest.yaml
```

`manifest.yaml` records: entity, period, framework, preparer, reviewer, approver, release state, doctrine version, quality-gate manifest, hash of every file.

## Print fidelity

Every report has a print stylesheet per `doctrine/references/print-fidelity.md`. Mandatory printed elements:

- Entity name, TIN, address, period, framework.
- Page X of Y on every page.
- Money triplet (net / tax / gross) preserved where applicable.
- Status chips with text labels (no colour-only signals).
- Sign-off boxes on the last page of every audit-relevant report.
- 60 × 60 mm stamp area on the cover of every audit-relevant report.
- `DRAFT` watermark while status is pre-sign-off.

## Sign-off

| Report group | Preparer | Reviewer | Approver |
|---|---|---|---|
| TB / GL / journal listing | Accountant | Controller | — |
| Financial statements | Accountant | Controller | CFO / Directors (year-end) |
| AR / AP / Inventory / FA / Payroll | Accountant | Controller | — |
| Reconciliation evidence packs | Accountant | Controller | — |
| Tax pack | Accountant | Tax Reviewer + Controller | — |
| Management accounts | Controller | CFO | — |
| Donor / grant pack | Controller | CFO (or grant manager) | — |

Sign-off recorded in the audit log with role, name, timestamp, and report version.

## Release governance

A pack is `released` after Controller sign-off and after all caveats are resolved or formally waived. A year-end pack is `released` after Director sign-off. Once released, the pack is immutable: subsequent corrections become prior-period adjustments per Section 10 / IAS 8.

## Acceptance evidence

- Pack content list complete per the table above.
- Print preview validated for every report.
- Drilldown chain validated by random sample (auditor walks five figures back to source).
- Sign-off audit-log entries present.
- Quality-gate manifest attached.

## Forbidden patterns

- Reports without a print stylesheet (blocker).
- Summary figures without drilldown (blocker).
- Released pack edited in place after release (use prior-period adjustment).
- Auditor export missing the index or the audit-log CSV.
- PDF exports re-rendered as image (loss of text searchability).

## Files

- `SKILL.md`.
- `references/notes-templates.md` — note templates for IFRS for SMEs and full IFRS.
- `references/auditor-export-format.md` — full file-format spec.
- `examples/may-2026-monthly-pack.md` — worked example pack manifest.
