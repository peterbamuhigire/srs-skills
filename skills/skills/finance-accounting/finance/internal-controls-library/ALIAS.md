# Internal Controls Library

## Overview

Internal controls are embedded in workflows, not written only as policy text. Each control has: trigger, owner, mechanism, evidence, review cadence, exception handling, and audit-log linkage.

## Required first reads

- `doctrine/accounting-finance-doctrine.md`
- `doctrine/references/ledger-invariants.md`
- `doctrine/references/role-conditioned-shell.md`
- `doctrine/references/required-patterns.md`
- `doctrine/references/forbidden-patterns.md`

## Core controls

### Segregation of duties (SoD)

Maker, checker, approver, accountant, controller, auditor, administrator. Same person cannot end-to-end:

- Create a supplier and approve a payment to that supplier.
- Post a journal and approve it.
- Modify payroll master and approve a payroll run.
- Reopen a locked period and post into it.
- Edit a tax rate and produce a tax return that uses it.

The role registry enforces the conflicts.

### Maker-checker

Applies to: payments, refunds, credit notes, manual journals, opening balances, tax settings, supplier master changes, payroll master changes, period reopen, allocation rules.

Maker creates → status `awaiting-approval` → checker reviews → status `approved` → posting service commits → status `posted`.

### Approval thresholds

Configured per entity, per action, per role. E.g.:

- Cashier refund ≤ UGX 50,000 self-approved.
- Manager refund ≤ UGX 500,000 manager-approved.
- Accountant refund ≤ UGX 5,000,000 accountant + controller.
- Above threshold: controller + CFO.

Thresholds carry verification-current state (rates change; verify at adoption).

### Supplier master-data controls

- Adding a supplier requires Accountant + Controller approval.
- Changing supplier bank or mobile-money details requires re-approval and a confirmation by independent contact.
- Master-data change history retained.
- Duplicate detection on add (name / TIN / bank account).

### Payroll master-data controls

- New employee setup: HR + Payroll + Accountant.
- Salary change: HR + Payroll + Accountant; reviewed by Controller monthly.
- Recipient (bank / mobile-money) change: confirmation by employee plus HR.
- Termination: HR + Payroll; final-pay reviewed.

### Petty cash controls

- Imprest amount fixed per location.
- Reconciliation cadence: weekly minimum.
- Replenishment via approved expense report.
- Cash count by independent role periodically.

### Cash drawer controls

- Cash drawer opened by cashier (recorded).
- Close drawer: counted vs computed; variance flagged.
- Variance > threshold escalates to manager.
- Drawer cannot be closed silently with variance.

### Inventory master-data controls

- New SKU / item: Inventory Manager + Accountant.
- UOM change: Inventory Manager + Accountant + Controller (because of historic cost effect).
- Valuation method per item-class fixed by entity policy.
- Obsolescence / write-off: Inventory Manager + Accountant.
- Standard cost change: Inventory Manager + Controller; effective dated; legacy unaffected.

### Tax / rate table controls

- Tax rate add or change: Tax Reviewer + Controller.
- Source-register entry required.
- Effective period must be specified.
- Recheck date set per `live-rate-verification-protocol.md`.

### Audit-log review

- Daily review by Controller of high-risk actions (refunds above threshold, reversals, period reopens, master-data changes).
- Monthly review by Internal Audit of full audit-log sample.
- Exceptions raised within 24 hours of detection.

### Exception monitoring

Continuous monitoring of:

- Duplicate suppliers (matching TIN, bank, mobile, name).
- Round-sum payments above threshold.
- Unexplained variances above threshold.
- Unmatched deposits ageing.
- Stale clearing items ageing.
- Backdated postings into open periods.
- Repeated reversals by the same actor.
- Period reopens.
- Supplier bank-detail changes followed by payment within 24 hours.
- Payroll changes followed by salary uplift within 24 hours.
- Tax-rate changes by non-Tax-Reviewer roles.

### Fraud / error indicator dashboards

- Indicator list above, each with threshold and owner.
- Weekly review at branch level by manager.
- Monthly review at entity level by Controller.
- Quarterly review at group level by CFO / Internal Audit.

## Control evidence

Each control has:

- Trigger description.
- Owner role.
- Mechanism (configuration, code path, scheduled review).
- Evidence type (audit log, report, sign-off).
- Cadence.
- Exception handling.

A control register is part of the management pack at year-end.

## Role-of-the-administrator boundary

The Administrator role can:

- Create users.
- Assign roles.
- Configure environments.
- Manage integrations.

The Administrator cannot:

- Approve a payment.
- Approve a journal reversal.
- Reopen a period.
- Edit a tax rate.
- Approve master-data changes.

Where an administrator action affects accounting (role assignment giving accounting power, environment promotion), Controller approval is required and the audit log records both signatures.

## Forbidden patterns

- Single user with all roles (blocker).
- Administrator with implicit accounting approval (blocker).
- Master-data changes without history (blocker).
- Audit-log review skipped for more than 7 consecutive days (major).
- Manual journals without maker-checker on amounts > 0 (blocker).
- Period reopen without dual approval (blocker).

## Acceptance evidence

- Control register with cadence and evidence.
- Configuration screenshots / exports.
- Audit-log sample review.
- Exception-monitoring dashboard.
- Sign-off log of monthly and quarterly reviews.

## Files

- `SKILL.md`.
- `references/sod-conflict-matrix.md`.
- `references/exception-indicators.md`.
- `examples/payment-approval-flow.md`.
