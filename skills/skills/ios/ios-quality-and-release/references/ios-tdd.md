## Platform Notes

- Optional helper plugins may help in some environments, but they must not be treated as required for this skill.

## Use When

- iOS Test-Driven Development standards. Enforces Red-Green-Refactor cycle, test pyramid (70/20/10), layer-specific testing strategies with XCTest and Swift Testing, and CI integration. Use when building or reviewing iOS apps with TDD methodology.
- The task needs reusable judgment, domain constraints, or a proven workflow rather than ad hoc advice.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is unrelated to `ios-tdd` or would be better handled by a more specific companion skill.
- The request only needs a trivial answer and none of this skill's constraints or references materially help.

## Required Inputs

- Gather relevant project context, constraints, and the concrete problem to solve; load `references` only as needed.
- Confirm the desired deliverable: design, code, review, migration plan, audit, or documentation.

## Workflow

- Read this `SKILL.md` first, then load only the referenced deep-dive files that are necessary for the task.
- Apply the ordered guidance, checklists, and decision rules in this skill instead of cherry-picking isolated snippets.
- Produce the deliverable with assumptions, risks, and follow-up work made explicit when they matter.

## Quality Standards

- Keep outputs execution-oriented, concise, and aligned with the repository's baseline engineering standards.
- Preserve compatibility with existing project conventions unless the skill explicitly requires a stronger standard.
- Prefer deterministic, reviewable steps over vague advice or tool-specific magic.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating examples as copy-paste truth without checking fit, constraints, or failure modes.
- Loading every reference file by default instead of using progressive disclosure.

## Outputs

- A concrete result that fits the task: implementation guidance, review findings, architecture decisions, templates, or generated artifacts.
- Clear assumptions, tradeoffs, or unresolved gaps when the task cannot be completed from available context alone.
- References used, companion skills, or follow-up actions when they materially improve execution.

## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Correctness | iOS TDD test plan | Markdown doc per `skill-composition-standards/references/test-plan-template.md` covering Red-Green-Refactor cycles per layer | `docs/ios/tdd-plan-checkout.md` |
| Correctness | Test pyramid coverage report | Markdown doc showing 70/20/10 distribution and per-layer coverage | `docs/ios/tdd-coverage-2026-04-16.md` |

## Overview

TDD is a development process where you write tests **before** feature code, following the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle. Every feature starts with a failing test, gets minimal implementation, then is refined.

**Core Principle:** No production code without a failing test first.

**Preferred Framework:** Swift Testing (`@Test` macro) for all new unit and integration tests. Use XCTest only for UI tests (XCUITest) and legacy test suites.

**Dependency Injection:** Protocol-based injection — no DI framework required. Define protocols for all external dependencies, inject via initialiser parameters.
