# SaaS Tenant Onboarding Automation
Acknowledgement: Shared by Peter Bamuhigire, techguypeter.com, +256 784 464178.

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- Designing the onboarding pipeline of a multi-tenant SaaS — sub-60-second self-serve provisioning from form submission to a usable tenant.
- Replacing a manual / partial / fragile onboarding flow (the founder is in every signup) with an idempotent orchestrated saga.
- Adding per-tenant infrastructure provisioning (silo / pod) to an existing onboarding pipeline without sacrificing onboarding time-to-ready.
- Designing the failed-onboarding recovery story — observability, retries, compensations, support escalation.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is general saga design — use `distributed-systems-patterns` for the underlying pattern.
- The task is the full control plane — use `saas-control-plane-engineering`; this skill is one of its services.
- The task is configuring Stripe Customer/Subscription primitives — use `subscription-billing`; this skill calls those primitives.
- The task is in-product activation / aha-event design — use `product-led-growth`; this skill ends at "tenant active", PLG starts at "drive to activation".

## Required Inputs

- Tenancy model from `multi-tenant-saas-architecture` (silo vs pool determines provisioning workload).
- Plan catalogue + trial policy from `subscription-billing`.
- Identity model from `saas-control-plane-engineering`.
- Email infra from `saas-transactional-email-infrastructure`.
- Default seed data (catalogue, roles, sample records) from product requirements.

## Workflow

1. Read this `SKILL.md`. Load `distributed-systems-patterns` if you need the saga underpinnings.
2. Map your tenant's provisioning to the 7 onboarding steps (§2) — for each, decide synchronous vs async.
3. Choose the saga style (§3) — orchestrated (Temporal / Step Functions / custom state machine) vs choreographed (event chain).
4. Define each step's idempotency key, retry policy, and compensation (§4).
5. Define observability — every step emits start/end/duration with `correlation_id` and `tenant_id` (§5).
6. Wire failure modes — partial failures → `failed` state, alert, retry endpoint (§6).
7. Instrument the activation funnel — `signup`, `pending → ready`, `first_login`, `aha_event`, `activated` (§7).
8. Apply anti-pattern checklist (§9).

## Quality Standards

- Median signup-to-ready < 30 seconds for pool model; < 5 minutes for silo with provisioning.
- p99 signup-to-ready < 2 minutes for pool model; < 15 minutes for silo.
- Failed-onboarding rate < 0.5%. Every failure is observable and retriable.
- Saga is **idempotent end-to-end** — rerunning with the same idempotency key is safe.
- Every step writes structured logs with `correlation_id`, `tenant_id`, `step_name`, `duration_ms`, `status`.

## Anti-Patterns

- Onboarding implemented as a 300-line `signupController.create()` method with no state, no retry, no observability.
- Sending the welcome email before the tenant is actually usable.
- Stripe customer created but tenant infrastructure provisioning then fails; result is a Stripe customer with no tenant, never reconciled.
- No `correlation_id` propagated through steps; debugging requires log archaeology.
- Synchronous waiting on slow steps (e.g., DNS propagation for custom subdomain) so the UI hangs; should be async with status polling.
- No compensation defined for partial failures (orphaned Stripe customers, leaked IdP users).

## Outputs

- Onboarding saga design — steps, dependencies, sync/async breakdown.
- Idempotency key strategy + retry/backoff policy per step.
- Compensation matrix (step X failed → undo Y and Z).
- Observability spec — events emitted, dashboards, alerts.
- Activation funnel events for downstream consumption (email automation, analytics).

## §1 Why Onboarding Is The Most Important Flow

Onboarding is the front door. Every other flow is downstream of it. Get it wrong and:
- Time-to-value stretches; activation suffers; trial-to-paid drops.
- Half-provisioned tenants pollute the database forever.
- Stripe customers without tenants accumulate; reconciliation becomes a nightmare.
- Failed onboarding silently fails; support gets the angry tickets days later.

The Trio book treats onboarding automation as **the single graduation requirement** between $1M and $10M ARR. The earlier you build it correctly, the cheaper your scale.

## §2 The Seven Onboarding Steps

| # | Step | Sync/Async (pool) | Sync/Async (silo) | Can fail? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create tenant record (status `pending`) | Sync | Sync | Rarely (DB issue) |
| 2 | Bootstrap identity (auth realm or just create first user) | Sync | Sync | Yes (email collision, IdP outage) |
| 3 | Provision infrastructure | n/a (skip) | **Async** (mins) | Yes (cloud quota, IaC failure) |
| 4 | Create billing customer + start trial subscription | Sync | Sync | Yes (Stripe outage, declined card) |
| 5 | Seed default data (catalogue, roles, sample records) | Sync | Async | Rarely |
| 6 | Send welcome email + magic-link / verification | Async | Async | Rarely (ESP queueing) |
| 7 | Emit activation telemetry, flip tenant to `ready` | Sync | Sync | Rarely |

**Pool model:** all sync steps complete within ~2-5 seconds; user sees the workspace immediately.

**Silo model:** sync steps complete in ~2 seconds → return "Setting up your workspace, we'll email you when it's ready" → async provisioning takes minutes → completion email + redirect.

## §3 Saga Style Choice

### Orchestrated (recommended for SaaS)
A central orchestrator service drives the sequence, knows the state, handles retries and compensations.

**Engines:**
- **Temporal** / **Cadence** — purpose-built, durable, retries built-in. Best for silo (long-running provisioning).
- **AWS Step Functions** — managed; good if already on AWS.
- **n8n / Airflow** — workflow tools; lighter weight; fine for v1.
- **Custom DB-state-machine** — a `onboarding_runs` table with `current_step`, `status`, `retry_count`, polled by a worker. Simplest; fine for pool with sub-second steps.

### Choreographed (event chain)
Each step listens for the prior step's event, runs, emits the next event. No central orchestrator.

**Pros:** loose coupling, scales horizontally.
**Cons:** state is implicit (which event last fired?), retries hard, compensations require reverse-event chain. Hard to reason about.

**Default choice for SaaS:** orchestrated. Onboarding is short-lived and benefits from a single source of truth for state.

## §4 Per-Step Idempotency, Retry, Compensation

```
Step: Create Stripe Customer
  Idempotency key: stripe-customer-{onboarding_run_id}
  Retry: 3x with exponential backoff (200ms, 1s, 5s)
  Compensation: delete Stripe customer (if next steps fail)
  Stripe API native idempotency: Idempotency-Key header

Step: Provision Infrastructure (silo)
  Idempotency key: infra-{tenant_id}
  Retry: 5x with exponential backoff (5s, 30s, 2m, 10m, 30m)
  Compensation: terraform destroy / cloud delete
  Surface as 'provisioning' status to UI; poll for ready

Step: Bootstrap Identity
  Idempotency key: identity-{tenant_id}
  Retry: 3x
  Compensation: delete IdP user / realm
  Atomic with: create first user_tenant_membership row

Step: Seed Defaults
  Idempotency key: seed-{tenant_id}-{seed_version}
  Retry: 3x
  Compensation: truncate tenant tables (only if tenant is still in pending state)

Step: Send Welcome Email
  Idempotency key: welcome-{tenant_id}
  Retry: handled by ESP queue
  Compensation: (none — emails are non-critical for ready state)

Step: Flip to Ready + Emit tenant.created
  Idempotency key: flip-{tenant_id}
  Retry: 3x
  Compensation: (none — terminal step)
```

## §5 Observability

Every step emits:
```json
{
  "event": "onboarding.step.completed",
  "correlation_id": "ob_2026_05_11_abc123",
  "tenant_id": 12345,
  "step": "stripe_customer_create",
  "status": "ok",
  "duration_ms": 423,
  "retry_count": 0,
  "actor_user_id": 678,
  "ip_address": "203.0.113.1",
  "user_agent": "..."
}
```

Dashboards:
- **Onboarding funnel:** signups → step1 → step2 → … → ready. Conversion at each step.
- **Onboarding latency:** p50 / p95 / p99 per step + total.
- **Onboarding failures:** by step, by error code, count + rate.
- **Failed onboardings retry queue:** tenants in `failed` state, retry attempts, age.

Alerts:
- Onboarding failure rate > 1% in 5-min window.
- Onboarding p95 > 60s (pool) or > 10min (silo).
- Stripe step failure rate > 2% in 5-min window (indicates Stripe outage or pricing config drift).

## §6 Failure Recovery

**State during failure:** `tenants.status = 'failed'`, `onboarding_runs.status = 'failed'`, `failed_step` recorded.

**Recovery options:**
1. **Auto-retry** — orchestrator retries with backoff. If exhausted, escalate.
2. **Admin retry** — admin console exposes a "Retry onboarding" button on failed tenants. Submits the saga with the same idempotency keys (so completed steps short-circuit).
3. **Admin manual repair** — if auto-retry can't recover (e.g., misconfigured plan), admin fixes the underlying issue then retries.
4. **Hard abort** — admin marks failed run as abandoned; saga runs compensations to clean up; tenant deleted from DB.

## §7 Activation Funnel — Where Onboarding Hands Off

Onboarding ends at `tenant.ready`. PLG begins at `tenant.first_login`. The handoff is the **activation funnel**:

```
signup → pending → ready → first_login → first_action → first_value (aha) → activated → engaged → retained
   │        │       │         │             │              │                  │            │           │
   │        │       │         │             │              │                  │            │           └── d+30 still active
   │        │       │         │             │              │                  │            └── d+7 still active
   │        │       │         │             │              │                  └── product-defined activation event
   │        │       │         │             │              └── "aha moment" — first time core value experienced
   │        │       │         │             └── any meaningful action (create, invite, upload)
   │        │       │         └── magic-link clicked or password set
   │        │       └── onboarding saga complete
   │        └── saga started
   └── form submitted
```

Every transition is an event. PLG + lifecycle email engine + analytics all subscribe.

## §8 The Asynchronous-Silo Pattern

When silo provisioning takes minutes, UX must not block. Pattern:

```
1. Submit form
2. Sync: create tenant row (status pending), create Stripe customer, create first user
3. Redirect to /onboarding/status?tenant=abc
4. Async: provisioning runs in background
5. /onboarding/status polls or uses WebSocket; shows "Setting up your environment..."
6. On completion: status flips to ready, page redirects to dashboard, email sent
```

Or: skip the wait page entirely — let the user explore a "minimal" pooled environment immediately; provision the silo in the background; transparently switch when ready.

## §9 Anti-Patterns

- **No `correlation_id`.** Cannot trace one onboarding's path through services. Fix: generate at form submit; propagate everywhere.
- **Welcome email sent before tenant is `ready`.** User clicks the link → 404 or blank workspace. Fix: send email after `tenant.ready` event.
- **Stripe customer created → infra step fails → no cleanup.** Stripe accumulates orphan customers. Fix: compensation deletes Stripe customer.
- **No idempotency keys.** Retry creates duplicate Stripe customers, duplicate users. Fix: `Idempotency-Key` header on every external call; persist them.
- **Saga state in app memory.** Worker dies mid-saga, state lost. Fix: persist `onboarding_runs.current_step` and `status` in DB.
- **No retry endpoint.** Failed onboardings are dead; manual SQL surgery. Fix: admin console "Retry" button.
- **Seed data hard-coded in app code instead of versioned.** Updating defaults retroactively breaks old tenants. Fix: seed-version per tenant; idempotent re-seed only safe for the same version.
- **Onboarding latency unmonitored.** Slow onboarding silently kills conversion. Fix: dashboard + alert on p95.

## §10 Sample DB-State-Machine Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE onboarding_runs (
    id                   BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    correlation_id       VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    tenant_id            BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    initiator_email      VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    initiator_ip         VARCHAR(45),
    status               ENUM('running','succeeded','failed','abandoned') NOT NULL,
    current_step         VARCHAR(64),
    failed_step          VARCHAR(64),
    failed_reason        TEXT,
    retry_count          INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    started_at           DATETIME NOT NULL,
    completed_at         DATETIME,
    payload              JSON NOT NULL,    -- the signup form data
    step_state           JSON,             -- per-step idempotency keys + outputs
    INDEX idx_status     (status),
    INDEX idx_started    (started_at)
);
```

Worker loop:
```python
while True:
    run = db.fetch_pending_run()    # SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    if not run: time.sleep(1); continue
    try:
        execute_next_step(run)      # advances current_step; persists step_state
    except RetryableError as e:
        run.retry_count += 1
        if run.retry_count >= MAX_RETRIES:
            fail_run(run, e)
            alert(run)
        else:
            schedule_retry(run, backoff(run.retry_count))
    except FatalError as e:
        fail_run(run, e)
        run_compensations(run)
        alert(run)
```
