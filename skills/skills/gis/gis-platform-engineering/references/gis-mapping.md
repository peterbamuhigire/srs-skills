## Use When

- Use for web apps that need Leaflet-first GIS mapping, location selection, map-driven UIs, or geofencing validation. Covers Leaflet setup, optional tile providers, data storage, and backend validation patterns.
- The task needs reusable judgment, domain constraints, or a proven workflow rather than ad hoc advice.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is unrelated to `gis-mapping` or would be better handled by a more specific companion skill.
- The request only needs a trivial answer and none of this skill's constraints or references materially help.

## Required Inputs

- Gather relevant project context, constraints, and the concrete problem to solve; load `references` only as needed.
- Confirm the desired deliverable: design, code, review, migration plan, audit, or documentation.

## Workflow

- Read this `SKILL.md` first, then load only the referenced deep-dive files that are necessary for the task.
- Apply the ordered guidance, checklists, and decision rules in this skill instead of cherry-picking isolated snippets.
- Produce the deliverable with assumptions, risks, and follow-up work made explicit when they matter.

## Quality Standards

- Keep outputs execution-oriented, concise, and aligned with the repository's baseline engineering standards.
- Preserve compatibility with existing project conventions unless the skill explicitly requires a stronger standard.
- Prefer deterministic, reviewable steps over vague advice or tool-specific magic.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating examples as copy-paste truth without checking fit, constraints, or failure modes.
- Loading every reference file by default instead of using progressive disclosure.

## Outputs

- A concrete result that fits the task: implementation guidance, review findings, architecture decisions, templates, or generated artifacts.
- Clear assumptions, tradeoffs, or unresolved gaps when the task cannot be completed from available context alone.
- References used, companion skills, or follow-up actions when they materially improve execution.

## When to Use

- You need interactive maps for customers, assets, farms, or delivery zones
- Users must select or edit locations on a map
- You must enforce geo-fencing or boundary validation
- You need GIS data display with filters, legends, and clustering

## Key Patterns

- Leaflet is the default mapping engine.
- Always include attribution for the chosen tile provider.
- Capture geometry in GeoJSON and validate server-side.
- Use bounding-box checks before deeper polygon math.
- Cluster markers when data is large or dense.
- Store optional tile provider API keys in system settings (e.g., `osm_api_key`) and load them at runtime.
- Default to terrain tiles (OpenTopoMap) for administrative borders.

## Leaflet Standardization (BIRDC)

- Use a shared Leaflet configuration for tile URLs, attribution, and defaults.
- Prefer a shared loader or include pattern so Leaflet CSS/JS is consistent across pages.
- Use the project's canonical Leaflet profile page as the UI reference for layering, interactions, and map controls.

## Stack Choices (Frontend)

- **Leaflet (default)**: Lightweight, fastest to implement, best for most apps.
- **OpenLayers (optional)**: Heavyweight GIS controls and projections.
- **MapLibre GL JS (optional)**: Vector tiles, smoother at scale.

## Data Model & Storage

- **Point**: `latitude` + `longitude` (DECIMAL(10,7))
- **Polygon/Boundary**: Store as GeoJSON (TEXT/JSON)
- **Metadata**: `location_label`, `address`, `last_updated_at`

Recommended formats:

- GeoJSON for portability across JS + backend
- WKT only if your DB tooling depends on it

## Map Initialization (Leaflet)

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css"
/>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
```

```javascript
const map = L.map("map").setView([0.3476, 32.5825], 12);
const osmApiKey = window.osmApiKey || "";
const osmTileUrl = osmApiKey
  ? `https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?api_key=${osmApiKey}`
  : "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png";

const osm = L.tileLayer(osmTileUrl, {
  attribution: "© OpenStreetMap contributors",
  maxZoom: 19,
});

const terrain = L.tileLayer(
  "https://{s}.tile.opentopomap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
  {
    attribution: "© OpenTopoMap",
    maxZoom: 17,
  },
);

terrain.addTo(map);
```

## Location Selection Patterns

### Marker (Point)

- Single click adds/updates a marker
- Store coordinates in hidden inputs

```javascript
let marker;
map.on("click", (e) => {
  if (marker) map.removeLayer(marker);
  marker = L.marker(e.latlng).addTo(map);
  document.querySelector("#latitude").value = e.latlng.lat;
  document.querySelector("#longitude").value = e.latlng.lng;
});
```

### Polygon / Rectangle (Area)

Use Leaflet Draw or Geoman. Store GeoJSON geometry.

```javascript
const drawn = new L.FeatureGroup().addTo(map);
const drawControl = new L.Control.Draw({
  draw: { polygon: true, rectangle: true, marker: false, circle: false },
  edit: { featureGroup: drawn },
});
map.addControl(drawControl);

map.on("draw:created", (e) => {
  drawn.clearLayers();
  drawn.addLayer(e.layer);
  document.querySelector("#boundary_geojson").value = JSON.stringify(
    e.layer.toGeoJSON(),
  );
});
```

## Geofencing (Overview)

Geofencing must be enforced at two levels:

- **UI constraint**: prevent invalid selections in the browser
- **Server constraint**: verify boundaries in backend validation

See geofencing.md for full patterns, point-in-polygon checks, and multi-geometry rules.

## UI Patterns

- Filters + stats in a side card, map in a large canvas
- Legend to toggle categories (customer groups, territories)
- Clustering when markers exceed ~200

## Performance & UX

- Debounce search and map redraw
- Use marker clustering or server-side tiling
- Lazy load heavy layers
- Simplify large polygons for UI display
- Pick a rendering strategy by feature count — see references/rendering-thresholds.md for the full table. Short form:
  - < 200 features: plain markers/SVG
  - 200–2 000 points: `Leaflet.markercluster`
  - 200–5 000 polygons: `preferCanvas: true` on the map
  - 2 000–10 000: server-side bbox filtering + per-zoom geometry simplification
  - \> 10 000: switch to MVT via `Leaflet.VectorGrid` or MapLibre/Mapbox GL
  - \> 50 000: WebGL overlay (`Leaflet.glify`, `PixiOverlay`)
- Return zoom-appropriate geometry from the backend — one simplification tolerance for all zooms is always wrong.

## Anti-Patterns (map-specific)

- Loading multi-megabyte GeoJSON at zoom 3 "for completeness" — simplify per zoom.
- Client-side reprojection on every pan — project server-side, deliver EPSG:4326.
- SVG renderer for 10 k+ polygons — switch to Canvas or vector tiles.
- Heatmap under ~200 points — implies density that is not statistically there.
- Two plugins for the same job (e.g. `leaflet-draw` and Geoman both active) — event collisions, see references/leaflet-plugins.md.
- Leaving `L.marker` default icon in production — image path breaks when bundled (Webpack/Vite); use a custom icon or shim.

## Backend Validation

Always validate coordinates server-side:

- Ensure latitude is between -90 and 90
- Ensure longitude is between -180 and 180
- Enforce geofence boundaries with the same logic as UI
- Load optional tile provider keys (for example `osm_api_key`) from system settings when building map pages

## Privacy & Security

- Location data is sensitive: protect with permissions
- Never trust client-only validation
- Avoid exposing private coordinates without authorization

## Recommended Plugins

- Leaflet Draw or Leaflet Geoman (drawing tools)
- Leaflet MarkerCluster (performance)
- Leaflet Control Geocoder (search)
- Turf.js (geospatial analysis)
