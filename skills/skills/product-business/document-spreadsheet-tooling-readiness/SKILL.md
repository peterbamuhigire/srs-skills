# Document Spreadsheet Tooling Readiness

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- Before promising or creating `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`, application registers, scoring matrices, budgets, dashboards, price schedules, CV packs, reports, or annexes.
- When moving an engine to a new machine and confirming whether document/spreadsheet tooling is installed.

## Do Not Use When

- The user only asks for plain Markdown or a conceptual outline and no generated file is claimed.

## Required Inputs

- Desired output formats, local tooling access, plugin/connector availability, and any required templates.

## Workflow

- Check plugins/connectors first, then Python packages, then binaries.
- Run a one-file smoke test before production export.
- Choose a route and state fallback honestly.
- Never claim a file exists until it was generated and opened or validated.

## Quality Standards

- File-output claims are factual claims.
- Fallbacks are explicit, not silent.
- PDF conversion route must be known before promising PDF.

## Anti-Patterns

- Saying a Word, PDF, or Excel file was generated when only Markdown exists.
- Assuming LibreOffice, Pandoc, or a plugin exists without checking.
- Shipping a workbook without reopening or formula/control checks.

## Outputs

- Toolchain check, smoke-test result, route decision, fallback plan, and validation note.

## Core Workflow

1. Confirm requested formats and whether a generated file is actually required.
2. Prefer built-in document/spreadsheet plugins where available.
3. Check Python packages: openpyxl, XlsxWriter, pandas, python-docx, docxtpl, docxcompose, pypandoc, markdown, beautifulsoup4, lxml, pillow, PyMuPDF, pypdf, pdfplumber, reportlab.
4. Check binaries: pandoc, soffice/LibreOffice, wkhtmltopdf where needed, and tesseract for OCR tasks.
5. Run a minimal DOCX and XLSX smoke test before production output on a new machine.
6. Pick the generation route and record it in the deliverable notes.
7. Open, parse, or otherwise validate the generated file before telling the user it was created.
