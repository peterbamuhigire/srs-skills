## Use When

- Framework for writing winning technology grant applications. Covers grant landscape by sector (individuals, NGOs, libraries, health, education, universities), the winning proposal framework, needs assessment writing, project narrative structure...
- The task needs reusable judgment, domain constraints, or a proven workflow rather than ad hoc advice.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is unrelated to `technology-grant-writing` or would be better handled by a more specific companion skill.
- The request only needs a trivial answer and none of this skill's constraints or references materially help.

## Required Inputs

- Gather relevant project context, constraints, and the concrete problem to solve.
- Confirm the desired deliverable: design, code, review, migration plan, audit, or documentation.

## Workflow

- Read this `SKILL.md` first, then load only the referenced deep-dive files that are necessary for the task.
- Apply the ordered guidance, checklists, and decision rules in this skill instead of cherry-picking isolated snippets.
- Produce the deliverable with assumptions, risks, and follow-up work made explicit when they matter.

## Quality Standards

- Keep outputs execution-oriented, concise, and aligned with the repository's baseline engineering standards.
- Preserve compatibility with existing project conventions unless the skill explicitly requires a stronger standard.
- Prefer deterministic, reviewable steps over vague advice or tool-specific magic.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating examples as copy-paste truth without checking fit, constraints, or failure modes.
- Loading every reference file by default instead of using progressive disclosure.

## Outputs

- A concrete result that fits the task: implementation guidance, review findings, architecture decisions, templates, or generated artifacts.
- Clear assumptions, tradeoffs, or unresolved gaps when the task cannot be completed from available context alone.
- References used, companion skills, or follow-up actions when they materially improve execution.

## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Release evidence | Grant application document | Markdown doc covering applicant brief, methodology, budget, and impact per grant submission | `docs/grants/application-2026-04-16.md` |

## References

- Use the links and companion skills already referenced in this file when deeper context is needed.

Based on *Winning at IT: Grant Writing for Technology Grants* (Technology Grant News, 2010).

## When to Use

- Applying for a technology grant from a corporate foundation, government agency, or NGO funder
- Helping a client (school, health facility, library, NGO) apply for technology funding
- Evaluating whether a technology project is grant-eligible
- Preparing a funding strategy that includes grants alongside commercial revenue

**The core discipline:** *Grant writing is not about describing your technology. It is about
demonstrating that your technology solves a specific problem for a specific population, that
you have the capacity to execute, and that the funder's money will produce a measurable,
sustainable outcome.*

## 1. The Grant Landscape

### Types of Technology Grants by Sector

| Sector | Typical Focus | Common Funders |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **K-12 Education** | Classroom technology, digital literacy, STEM equipment | Corporate foundations (HP, Dell, Microsoft), government education ministries |
| **Higher Education** | Research computing, digital humanities, lab infrastructure | NSF, government research councils, corporate R&D partnerships |
| **Libraries and Museums** | Digital access, digitisation, online collections | IMLS, NEH, national library boards |
| **Health** | Health IT, electronic records, telemedicine infrastructure | NIH, NLM, health ministries, GAVI, Gates Foundation |
| **Non-Profits** | Digital tools for service delivery, data management | Corporate CSR programmes (Dell, HP, Motorola), community foundations |
| **Individuals / Researchers** | Fellowship, innovation competition, scholarship | AAUW, NSF Graduate Fellowships, academic competitions |

### Corporate vs Government Grants

| Dimension | Corporate Grant | Government Grant |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Application process** | Typically shorter; less formal | Formal; prescribed format; strict word/page limits |
| **Decision timeline** | 4–12 weeks | 6–18 months |
| **Award amounts** | Small to medium (USD 5,000–250,000) | Medium to large (USD 50,000–5,000,000+) |
| **Reporting requirements** | Light (narrative report) | Formal (financial audit, outcome metrics) |
| **Renewal likelihood** | Common with strong relationship | Competitive each cycle |

## 2. The Winning Proposal Framework

Every winning technology grant proposal answers five questions in sequence:

1. **What is the problem?** (Needs Assessment)
2. **What is your solution?** (Project Description / Narrative)
3. **How will you know it worked?** (Evaluation Plan)
4. **Can you actually do this?** (Organisational Capacity)
5. **How much does it cost and why?** (Budget Justification)

*Funders read thousands of applications. They are looking for reasons to say no. Your job is
to give them no reason to doubt any of these five answers.*

## 3. The Needs Assessment

The needs assessment is the most important section in any grant application. Funders do not fund
ideas — they fund demonstrated, evidenced needs.

### Rules for a Compelling Needs Assessment

1. **Quantify the problem.** "40% of students in our district lack access to a computer at home"
   is compelling. "Many students lack digital access" is not.

2. **Cite sources.** National statistics, government reports, census data, peer-reviewed research.
   Uncited claims are opinions. Cited claims are evidence.

3. **Connect the problem to the funder's mission.** If the funder's stated goal is "closing the
   digital divide in underserved communities," your needs assessment must explicitly connect your
   population's problem to that framing.

4. **Make the population visible.** Name the specific group: "350 students in Gulu District,
   ages 12–18, attending public secondary schools with no computer lab and no home internet access."
   Anonymous, aggregate populations are less compelling than specific, named ones.

5. **Explain why now.** What has changed recently that makes this need more urgent? New curriculum
   requirements? Pandemic learning loss? New connectivity infrastructure that enables a solution
   that was previously impossible?

---

## 4. Project Description (Narrative)

The project description translates the needs assessment into a concrete plan of action.

### Required Elements

**Objectives:** State 3–5 specific, measurable outcomes that the grant will produce.

Format: "By [date], [population] will [verb] [measurable outcome], as measured by [instrument]."

*Example:* "By June 2027, 95% of Form 4 students at St. Mary's College Kisubi will demonstrate
basic digital literacy skills (typing, internet research, document creation), as measured by a
standardised computer literacy assessment."

**Activities:** List the specific actions that will produce the objectives.

Use an ordered list. Funders want to see a logical causal chain from activity to outcome.

1. Procure and install 40 desktop computers and 1 server (Month 1–2).
2. Install solar power backup system to ensure reliability during outages (Month 2).
3. Train 8 teachers in the new digital literacy curriculum (Month 2–3).
4. Deliver digital literacy instruction to 350 students across 3 academic terms (Month 3–12).
5. Administer pre- and post-programme assessments to measure skill gain (Month 1 and 12).

**Timeline:** A Gantt-style table or milestone list with dates and responsible parties.

**Sustainability Plan:** How will this project continue after the grant period ends?
Funders are not funding a one-time event — they are investing in a sustainable change.
Address: maintenance budget (who pays?), staff capacity (who operates it?), institutional
commitment (what has leadership signed?).

---

## 5. Evaluation Plan

The evaluation plan tells the funder how you will prove the grant produced its intended outcomes.

### Process Evaluation vs Outcome Evaluation

| Type | What It Measures | Example |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| **Process** | Whether activities were implemented as planned | "Were all 8 teachers trained? Were all 350 students reached?" |
| **Outcome** | Whether the project produced the intended change | "Did student digital literacy scores improve?" |

Both are required. Process evaluation proves execution. Outcome evaluation proves impact.

### Evaluation Instruments

- Pre/post assessments (standardised tests for skill gain)
- Attendance records (participation tracking)
- User surveys (satisfaction and perceived value)
- Usage analytics (system logs — number of sessions, files created, hours used)
- Focus groups (qualitative depth on how and why)

### Reporting Commitments

State exactly what reports you will submit, when, and in what format.
Never commit to reporting requirements you cannot realistically meet.

---

## 6. Organisational Capacity

Funders invest in organisations, not just ideas. This section answers: "Can you actually do this?"

### What to Include

- **Track record:** Past projects of similar scale; previous grants received and successfully
  completed; letters of completion or endorsement from prior funders.
- **Team qualifications:** Relevant experience of key project staff. Named individuals with
  brief, evidence-backed bios (not generic "extensive experience" language).
- **Partnerships:** Named institutional partners who have formally committed to the project.
  A letter of support signed by a partner's director is worth more than any prose claim.
- **Financial health:** Evidence of financial management capacity — audited accounts, funder
  references, organisational registration.

*An impressive project description from an organisation with no track record will lose to a
modest project description from an organisation with a strong record of delivery.*

## 7. Budget Justification

The budget is not just a spreadsheet — it is a narrative that explains why every line item is
necessary and reasonable.

### Budget Principles

1. **Line-item every significant cost.** No lump sums. "Technology equipment: USD 45,000" is
   not a budget. "40 desktop computers @ USD 850 each = USD 34,000; 1 server @ USD 3,500;
   network switch and cabling = USD 3,200; UPS backup units (4) @ USD 600 = USD 2,400;
   installation and configuration = USD 1,900" is a budget.

2. **Show matching contributions.** Funders prefer co-investment. If your school is contributing
   the building, teacher time, or electricity — value it and show it as a match. It demonstrates
   commitment and reduces the funder's perceived risk.

3. **Justify indirect costs.** Most foundations allow 10–15% indirect (overhead) costs. Explain
   what this covers: financial management, payroll, utilities attributable to the project.

4. **Price honestly, not optimistically.** A budget that is too low signals inexperience.
   A budget that requires a large amendment 3 months in damages your relationship with the funder.
   Obtain actual quotes from suppliers before submitting.

5. **Align the budget with the activities.** Every activity line in the narrative must have a
   corresponding budget line. If an activity appears in the narrative but has no budget, the
   funder will ask how you plan to fund it.

## 8. Common Mistakes in Tech Grant Applications

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Describing the technology, not the problem | Funders fund impact, not tools | Lead with the need; introduce the technology as the solution |
| Vague population ("underserved communities") | Unmeasurable; not credible | Name the specific group with data |
| No sustainability plan | Funder does not want a one-time event | Show financial and institutional commitment beyond grant period |
| Objectives that are not measurable | Cannot prove success | Use the "By [date], [population] will [verb] [metric]" formula |
| Budget does not match narrative | Funder assumes mismanagement | Every activity must have a budget line |
| Ignoring the funder's stated priorities | Proposal does not align with the funder's mission | Mirror the funder's language and priorities explicitly |
| No evaluation instruments | Cannot prove outcomes | Name the specific test, survey, or log you will use |
| Generic letters of support | Signals pro forma engagement | Letters must reference the specific project and the signer's role in it |
