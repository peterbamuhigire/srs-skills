## Use When

- Handling a live service issue (complaint, error, delay, escalation, public-channel post).
- Drafting service language: apology, empathy, ownership, timeline, confirmation, escalation, refusal.
- Designing or auditing the service recovery and retention loop.
- Measuring service quality across response, resolution, recovery, retention.
- Aligning frontline empowerment with escalation paths and knowledge management (CX-EX alignment).
- Building a prevention loop so the same failure does not recur.

## Do Not Use When

- The work is pre-sale conversation; use `premium-client-sales`.
- The work is product feature evaluation; use `product-discovery`.
- The work is internal team conflict unrelated to a customer; use a coaching framework.
- The work is marketing copy at the top of the funnel; use the marketing/positioning skill.

## Required Inputs

- The customer's words (verbatim where possible) and the channel they used.
- Account context: tenure, value, prior issues, contract terms.
- The actual failure: what happened, what was promised, what gap.
- Authority limits of the agent handling the interaction (refund cap, credit cap, escalation triggers).

## Workflow

1. Run the **recovery-and-retention loop**: listen, acknowledge, diagnose, explain, options, act, confirm, document, prevent, follow up. Do not skip steps; the order matters.
2. Match the interaction type to a **difficult-interaction framework** (angry, anxious, technical-novice, executive, public-channel) and adapt language accordingly.
3. Use **service language patterns** for apology, empathy, ownership, timeline, confirmation, escalation. Each pattern has a structure and a prohibited phrase list.
4. Honour the **frontline empowerment ceiling**: if the resolution exceeds the agent's authority, escalate immediately rather than negotiating beyond authority.
5. Close with **explicit confirmation**: name what was done, what comes next, and the date the customer can hold you to.
6. Document the interaction with structured tags so it feeds the **service quality measurement** dashboard and the **prevention loop**.
7. Run a follow-up after resolution. Without follow-up, recovery is half-done.

## Quality Standards

- The customer's words are mirrored before any explanation begins.
- Apology is specific and ownership-bearing, not "we apologize for any inconvenience".
- Every commitment has a date, an owner, and a confirmation channel.
- Escalation is a service tool, not a defeat. Escalate before negotiating beyond authority.
- Public-channel responses move to private channel for resolution but acknowledge publicly first.
- Every documented failure produces either a knowledge-base entry, a process change, or a known-acceptable-loss decision.

## Anti-Patterns

- Apologising in passive voice ("mistakes were made"). Specific ownership outperforms generic regret.
- Explaining policy before acknowledging impact.
- Promising a callback "soon" instead of a specific time window.
- Treating the angry customer's tone as the issue. The tone is data; the issue is the failure.
- Closing the ticket because the customer went silent. Silence is not resolution.
- Making the customer repeat the story to a second agent. Hand-off discipline is part of service.
- Using empathy phrases as filler. Empathy without diagnosis is theatre.

## Outputs

- A resolved or escalated case with named owner and date.
- A written confirmation to the customer (channel of their choice).
- A structured tag set for measurement (response time, resolution path, recovery used, retention outcome).
- A prevention entry: knowledge-base update, process change, or accepted-loss note.
- A follow-up scheduled at an explicit date.

## Recovery and Retention Loop (the order, every time)

Listen -> Acknowledge -> Diagnose -> Explain -> Options -> Act -> Confirm -> Document -> Prevent -> Follow up.

Skipping listen produces explanation theatre. Skipping diagnose produces apology theatre. Skipping prevent produces the same failure next month. Skipping follow up produces silent churn.

## Authority Ceiling Rule

Frontline agents must have a published refund cap, credit cap, and escalation trigger. Negotiating beyond authority destroys two relationships at once: the customer's trust (they sense the discomfort) and the agent's relationship with their manager (escalating after a promise burns capital both ways).

## The Public-Channel Move

Public complaint -> public acknowledgement (under one hour, no defence, no detail) -> private channel handover -> resolution in private -> public closing note (only if the customer agrees). Resolving in public is theatre and invites pile-on.

## Service Failure Prevention Loop

Every documented failure produces one of three outcomes:

- A knowledge-base entry (the agent could have answered with the right information).
- A process change (the system allowed the failure; fix it or it recurs).
- An accepted-loss note (the failure cost is below the prevention cost; document and move on).

Without the third option, prevention loops accumulate well-meaning policy that no one follows.
