## Platform Notes

- Optional helper plugins may help in some environments, but they must not be treated as required for this skill.

## Use When

- Comprehensive, standardized error response system for PHP REST APIs with SweetAlert2 integration. Use when building REST APIs that need consistent error formatting, specific error message extraction from database exceptions, validation error...
- The task needs reusable judgment, domain constraints, or a proven workflow rather than ad hoc advice.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is unrelated to `api-error-handling` or would be better handled by a more specific companion skill.
- The request only needs a trivial answer and none of this skill's constraints or references materially help.

## Required Inputs

- Gather relevant project context, constraints, and the concrete problem to solve; load `references, examples` only as needed.
- Confirm the desired deliverable: design, code, review, migration plan, audit, or documentation.

## Workflow

- Read this `SKILL.md` first, then load only the referenced deep-dive files that are necessary for the task.
- Apply the ordered guidance, checklists, and decision rules in this skill instead of cherry-picking isolated snippets.
- Produce the deliverable with assumptions, risks, and follow-up work made explicit when they matter.

## Quality Standards

- Keep outputs execution-oriented, concise, and aligned with the repository's baseline engineering standards.
- Preserve compatibility with existing project conventions unless the skill explicitly requires a stronger standard.
- Prefer deterministic, reviewable steps over vague advice or tool-specific magic.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating examples as copy-paste truth without checking fit, constraints, or failure modes.
- Loading every reference file by default instead of using progressive disclosure.

## Outputs

- A concrete result that fits the task: implementation guidance, review findings, architecture decisions, templates, or generated artifacts.
- Clear assumptions, tradeoffs, or unresolved gaps when the task cannot be completed from available context alone.
- References used, companion skills, or follow-up actions when they materially improve execution.

## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Correctness | Error response contract | Markdown doc listing canonical error shapes, HTTP codes, and SweetAlert2 mapping | `docs/api/error-contract.md` |

## References

- Use the `references/` directory for deep detail after reading the core workflow below.
- Use the `examples/` directory for concrete patterns when implementation shape matters.

Implement comprehensive, standardized error response system for PHP REST APIs with consistent JSON envelopes, specific error message extraction, and SweetAlert2 integration.

**Core Principles:**

- Consistent JSON envelope across all endpoints
- Specific error messages extracted from all exception types
- Appropriate HTTP status codes for all error categories
- Machine-readable error codes for programmatic handling
- Human-readable messages for SweetAlert2 display
- Secure error handling (no stack traces in production)
- Comprehensive logging with request IDs
- **CRITICAL: Always show error messages to users in SweetAlert (never silent failures)**

**Security Baseline (Required):** Always load and apply the **Vibe Security Skill** for PHP API work. Do not leak sensitive data in responses or logs.

**Cross-Platform:** APIs deploy to Windows (dev), Ubuntu (staging), Debian (production), all running MySQL 8.x. Use `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` collation. Match file/directory case exactly in require paths (Linux is case-sensitive). Use forward slashes in paths.

**See subdirectories for:**

- `references/` - Complete PHP classes (ApiResponse, ExceptionHandler, Exceptions)
- `examples/` - Full endpoint implementation, frontend client

## Additional Guidance

Extended guidance for `api-error-handling` was moved to [references/skill-deep-dive.md](references/skill-deep-dive.md) to keep this entrypoint compact and fast to load.

Use that deep dive for:
- `Response Envelope Standard`
- `HTTP Status Codes`
- `ApiResponse Helper (Quick Reference)`
- `Exception Handler (Quick Reference)`
- `Custom Exception Classes`
- `API Bootstrap Pattern`
- `Endpoint Implementation Pattern`
- `Frontend Integration`
- `Critical Error Display Pattern`
- `Debugging Data Shape Mismatches`
- `API Contract Validation (Frontend-Backend Alignment)`
- `Error Message Extraction`
- Additional deep-dive sections continue in the reference file.
