<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- Authoring a new specialist skill and deciding which validation evidence it should produce.
- Normalising an older specialist skill against the current house style.
- Preparing a feature or release for ship and assembling the Release Evidence Bundle.
- Reviewing a PR that claims a feature is production-ready.

## Do Not Use When

- The work is purely local, experimental, or explicitly throwaway with no path to production.
- The skill being authored is a baseline, process, or pure index skill. Those do not declare evidence.
- The task is unrelated to validation planning or shipping readiness.

## Required Inputs

- The specialist skill or feature being validated, including its intended scope and risk tier.
- Access to the repository's existing validation skills (`advanced-testing-strategy`, `vibe-security-skill`, `observability-monitoring`, etc.) as the source of category-specific "how to validate" content.
- Awareness of the 14 canonical artifact templates in `skill-composition-standards/references/` so evidence rows can cite existing formats.

## Workflow

- Identify whether the skill or feature in scope is specialist (declares evidence) or baseline/process (does not).
- For specialist skills: map each artifact the skill produces to one of the seven evidence categories.
- For releases: produce a Release Evidence Bundle that links concrete artifacts under each of the seven categories, using `N/A — <reason>` only where an entire category legitimately does not apply.
- Cross-check risk tier guidance before permitting any `N/A` in high-risk releases.

## Quality Standards

- Every specialist skill that produces validation evidence declares at least one evidence category with a concrete artifact reference.
- Evidence declarations cite existing artifact templates where possible instead of inventing new formats.
- Release Evidence Bundles never carry empty cells. Every cell links evidence or carries an `N/A — <reason>` line.

## Anti-Patterns

- Declaring every category on every skill "just in case". This kills the signal.
- Writing prose validation notes instead of linking concrete artifacts in a Release Evidence Bundle.
- Permitting unjustified `N/A` on Correctness, Security, Data safety, Operability, or Release evidence in high-risk releases.
- Treating the Release Evidence Bundle as a retrospective summary written after ship. It is produced before ship.

## Outputs

- A specialist skill with a validated `## Evidence Produced` section declaring one or more of the seven categories.
- A Release Evidence Bundle in the project's `docs/` tree linking evidence for every applicable category at ship time.
- Clear `N/A — <reason>` annotations for non-applicable categories, with risk-tier-aware justification.

## The three repository-wide contracts

The repository is held together by three contracts, each codified in a baseline skill:

1. **House-style contract** — every skill follows the same shape. Source: `skill-composition-standards`, Standard 1.
2. **Inputs/Outputs contract** — every skill declares the artifacts it consumes and produces. Source: `skill-composition-standards`, Standard 2.
3. **Evidence contract** — every specialist skill declares which of seven fixed validation categories its artifacts contribute to, and every release produces a Release Evidence Bundle. Source: this skill.

The three contracts stack. A skill that meets Standard 1 but skips Standard 2 or 3 is not repository-grade.

## The seven evidence categories

| # | Category | What the evidence proves |
|---|----------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **Correctness** | Behaviour matches spec; tests cover risk surface; contracts hold. |
| 2 | **Security** | Threat model exists; scans clean; secrets handled; auth/authorisation verified. |
| 3 | **Data safety** | Schema integrity; migration safety; backup, retention, and PII handling. |
| 4 | **Performance** | Budgets met; load profile understood; query plans acceptable. |
| 5 | **Operability** | SLOs defined; runbook exists; observability wired; rollback plan ready. |
| 6 | **UX quality** | Accessibility pass; design audit; content/UX-writing review; AI slop check. |
| 7 | **Release evidence** | Change record; migration plan; rollout/rollback log; post-deploy verification. |

The taxonomy is closed. Adding an eighth category requires editing this skill, not silently extending it elsewhere. Full definitions and indicative contributing skills live in [references/evidence-categories.md](references/evidence-categories.md).

## Declaration mechanic

Specialist skills add a `## Evidence Produced` section to their `SKILL.md`, between `## Outputs` and `## References`:

```markdown
## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Security | Threat model | Markdown doc per `skill-composition-standards/references/threat-model-template.md` | `docs/security/threat-model-checkout.md` |
| Operability | Runbook | Markdown doc per `skill-composition-standards/references/runbook-template.md` | `docs/runbooks/payment-failures.md` |
```

### Rules

- A specialist skill that produces validation evidence **MUST** declare at least one row.
- Each row's `Category` value **MUST** be one of the seven canonical names (case-sensitive).
- Each row's `Format` field **MUST** reference an existing template or define its own format inline in the same `SKILL.md`.
- A specialist skill **MAY** contribute to multiple categories.
- Baseline skills, process skills, and pure index/orchestration skills **MUST NOT** declare.

Worked examples live in [references/declaration-form.md](references/declaration-form.md).

## Specialist vs exempt skills

A skill is "specialist" for the purposes of this contract when it:

- Produces concrete project artifacts (code patterns, schemas, configs, documents).
- Is loaded for a specific domain or platform problem rather than as a baseline frame.

Skills exempt from declaring (non-exhaustive):

- `world-class-engineering`, `skill-composition-standards`, `validation-contract` itself.
- `system-architecture-design`, `engineering-management-system`, `git-collaboration-workflow`.
- `feature-planning`, `spec-architect`.
- All `superpowers:*` skills.

When a skill straddles the line, the default is **declare**. False positives are cheaper than silent omissions.

## The Release Evidence Bundle

When a feature or release is ready to ship, the reviewer produces a single fillable document — the Release Evidence Bundle — that links to the concrete artifacts satisfying each of the seven categories.

- **Template:** [references/release-evidence-bundle-template.md](references/release-evidence-bundle-template.md).
- **`N/A` semantics:** permitted **only with a reason on the same line**. An empty cell is not acceptable.
- **Risk tier guidance:**
  - **Low risk** — internal tools, docs, non-user-facing scripts. Typical bundle has 3-4 categories live.
  - **Medium risk** — user-facing feature, single-tenant. All 7 categories addressed; some may be `N/A` with reason.
  - **High risk** — multi-tenant data, payments, auth, external APIs, AI features. All 7 categories live; no `N/A` permitted on Correctness, Security, Data safety, Operability, or Release evidence.

## Strictness

- The contract uses **MUST**, **MAY**, **MUST NOT** in the RFC 2119 sense.
- Mechanical enforcement is **out of scope** for this skill. It lands separately as a CI contract-gate hook that will:
  - parse `## Evidence Produced` tables and warn on missing or invalid categories.
  - parse Release Evidence Bundles and warn on empty cells or unjustified `N/A`.
- Authoring with binding language now means the CI hook is a parser and CI integration only, not a policy debate.

## Integration with existing skills

The rollout in [references/integration-rollout.md](references/integration-rollout.md) lists every edit made to other skills when this skill was introduced. Future edits that touch this contract should update that file.

## Companion Skills

- `skill-composition-standards` — Standards 1 and 2. Load this before `validation-contract`.
- `world-class-engineering` — repository production-readiness bar. This contract makes the evidence of meeting that bar a first-class artifact.
- Category-specific skills — the source of truth for *how* to validate within each category (see [references/evidence-categories.md](references/evidence-categories.md)).
