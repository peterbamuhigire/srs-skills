# C# And .NET Development
Acknowledgement: Shared by Peter Bamuhigire, techguypeter.com, +256 784 464178.

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- Building or reviewing C#/.NET code, services, APIs, workers, desktop/mobile apps, or libraries.
- Choosing .NET target frameworks, SDK versions, project layout, dependency boundaries, or deployment shape.
- Implementing ASP.NET Core endpoints, EF Core repositories, background jobs, async/parallel code, MAUI UI, Azure services, or .NET AI features.
- Modernizing older .NET Framework, Web Forms, WPF, WinForms, or early .NET Core code to current .NET.
- The task needs reusable judgment, domain constraints, or a proven workflow rather than ad hoc advice.

## Do Not Use When

- The work is only Avalonia UI; use `avalonia-desktop-development` for AXAML, Avalonia MVVM, styling, and packaging.
- The work is only generic architecture, data modelling, security, or CI/CD with no .NET-specific decisions; use the specialist skill first and return here for implementation details.
- The request only needs a trivial answer and none of this skill's constraints or references materially help.

## Required Inputs

- Current target framework, SDK, hosting model, package manager, and deployment target.
- Existing solution layout, project files, runtime errors, logs, tests, and relevant `.csproj`/`.sln` files.
- Data stores, external integrations, security model, scale assumptions, and platform targets.
- Desired deliverable: implementation, review findings, modernization plan, architecture decision, migration, test plan, or release evidence.

## Workflow

1. Identify the application shape: library, CLI, ASP.NET Core, worker, MAUI, desktop, Azure function, microservice, or AI-enabled service.
2. Verify the target framework and SDK. Prefer current LTS for production unless the project is explicitly pinned or compatibility requires otherwise.
3. Inspect project boundaries. Keep domain logic outside controllers, pages, XAML code-behind, EF `DbContext`, hosted services, and framework glue.
4. Apply C# idioms from `references/csharp-language-and-runtime.md` before adding abstractions.
5. Load only the relevant deep reference:
   - APIs/services: `references/aspnet-core-and-services.md`
   - EF Core/data: `references/ef-core-data-access.md`
   - MAUI UI: `references/dotnet-maui-cross-platform-ui.md`
   - Async/parallel work: `references/concurrency-and-parallelism.md`
   - Testing/release: `references/testing-packaging-and-operations.md`
   - AI integration: `references/ai-in-dotnet.md`
   - Source synthesis: `references/source-study-notes.md`
6. Implement or review with security, cancellation, structured logging, observability, performance, and testability as first-class concerns.
7. Validate with `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`, analyzers, formatters, and a realistic runtime smoke test when a project is available.

## Quality Standards

- Treat nullable reference types, analyzers, warnings, and source-generated validation as quality gates, not optional polish.
- Use dependency injection and options binding deliberately; keep service lifetimes correct and avoid service locator patterns.
- Make all I/O async and cancellation-aware. Do not block on `Task.Result`, `.Wait()`, or `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` in app code.
- Validate every boundary: HTTP, CLI args, config, queues, files, webhooks, external API responses, and AI/tool outputs.
- Prefer records/immutable value objects for data transfer and domain values; use classes for behaviour and identity.
- Keep EF Core queries explicit, measured, and projection-focused; avoid lazy-loading surprises on request paths.
- Add logging scopes, correlation IDs, health checks, metrics, and actionable errors before calling a service production-ready.
- Use platform-specific UI only behind thin adapters; keep MAUI view models and domain services testable without device APIs.

## Anti-Patterns

- Fat controllers, fat pages, fat hosted services, or XAML code-behind containing domain rules.
- `async void` outside UI event handlers, fire-and-forget tasks without supervised queues, or ignored `CancellationToken`.
- Returning EF entities directly from public APIs when contracts, privacy, or versioning matter.
- Global static state for clocks, configuration, database access, HTTP clients, or current user context.
- Swallowing exceptions, logging without context, or exposing raw exception details to users.
- Hand-written cryptography, custom authentication/session systems, or direct secret reads from source files.
- Treating `.NET Framework`, `.NET`, `.NET Core`, ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, MAUI, WPF, and Avalonia as interchangeable.

## Outputs

- Code changes, review findings, architecture decisions, migration plans, test strategy, release checklist, or implementation guidance.
- Explicit assumptions about target framework, platform support, data stores, threading, deployment, and compatibility.
- Validation evidence: commands run, tests added or skipped with reason, runtime smoke checks, and residual risk.

## Evidence Produced

| Category | Artifact | Format | Example |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Correctness | .NET verification log | Markdown or terminal summary with restore/build/test/analyzer/runtime smoke results | `docs/dotnet/verification.md` |
| Architecture | Boundary map | Markdown table of projects, responsibilities, dependencies, and forbidden references | `docs/dotnet/project-boundaries.md` |
| Operations | Release readiness checklist | Markdown checklist for config, health, telemetry, packaging, rollback, and owner | `docs/dotnet/release-readiness.md` |

## Project Defaults

Prefer this baseline unless the target project already has stronger conventions:

- `Directory.Build.props` with nullable enabled, implicit usings enabled, latest stable language version only when the SDK supports it, warnings treated seriously, and analyzers on.
- One solution with explicit projects: `Domain`, `Application`, `Infrastructure`, `Api`/`Worker`/`Maui`, and `Tests` for non-trivial systems.
- External dependencies behind interfaces or typed clients; contracts versioned separately from EF entities and UI models.
- `IOptions<T>` with validated configuration; secrets from environment, user secrets for local development, or managed secret stores.
- `TimeProvider`, `ILogger<T>`, `IHttpClientFactory`, `IHostedService`/`BackgroundService`, and `CancellationToken` instead of ad hoc infrastructure.
- `dotnet format`, analyzers, unit tests, integration tests, and smoke tests in CI.

## Review Checklist

- Does each project have a clear reason to exist, and are dependencies one-way?
- Are public contracts stable, documented, validated, and decoupled from persistence?
- Are async calls cancellation-aware and free from sync-over-async?
- Are secrets, auth, authorization, CORS, cookies, tokens, and data access scoped correctly?
- Are database queries projected, indexed, bounded, and observable?
- Are tests proving domain rules, API contracts, persistence behaviour, and critical failure paths?
- Can production operators diagnose startup, dependency failure, queue backlog, request latency, and release version quickly?
