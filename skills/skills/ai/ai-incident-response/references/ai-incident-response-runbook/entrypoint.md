<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- An AI signal has paged the on-call and the triage tree has produced a failure class.
- You are designing the operator-side surfaces (kill-switch, model-pin, prompt-pin, abstain-mode toggle) that the runbook depends on.
- Auditing whether the engine can actually execute the moves the runbook calls for in < 60 seconds.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is the detection / triage â€” `ai-incident-detection-and-triage`.
- The task is the postmortem â€” `ai-incident-postmortem`.
- The task is the recovery / re-promotion â€” `ai-incident-recovery-and-rollback`.
- The task is generic platform incident response â€” `reliability-engineering`.

## Required Inputs

- Triaged failure class label (from `ai-incident-detection-and-triage`).
- Functional kill-switch + model-pin + prompt-pin + gateway routing pin (from `ai-model-gateway`).
- Functional abstain-mode / read-only-mode per feature.
- Evidence-capture pipeline ready (from `ai-incident-evidence-capture`).
- Customer-comms templates ready (from `ai-incident-customer-comms`).

## Workflow

1. Read this `SKILL.md`.
2. Follow the **first 5 / 30 / 120-minute** universal playbook (Â§1).
3. Branch to the **per-failure-class playbook** (Â§2) using the failure-class label.
4. Decide and execute the **mitigation primitive** (Â§3).
5. Run **containment verification** (Â§4) â€” confirm the mitigation worked, not just that the switch was flipped.
6. Hand off to **recovery** (`ai-incident-recovery-and-rollback`) once stable.
7. Hand off to **postmortem** (`ai-incident-postmortem`) once recovered.
8. Apply anti-patterns (Â§5).

## Quality Standards

- Every mitigation primitive (kill-switch, model-pin, prompt-pin, index-pin, abstain-mode, read-only-mode, full feature rollback) is executable from a single operator surface in < 60 seconds.
- The on-call engineer never needs to write or edit code to execute a mitigation.
- Every mitigation logs a structured event with actor, timestamp, primitive, scope, reason.
- Containment is verified by signal (signal recovered) not assumed by switch flip.
- Time-to-mitigate target: sev-1 â‰¤ 1h, sev-2 â‰¤ 4h.
- Every playbook ends with a handoff into recovery + postmortem.

## Anti-Patterns

- Mitigation requires a PR, code review, and deploy. Not a runbook â€” a rebuild.
- Kill-switch flips silently, comms team finds out hours later from a customer ticket.
- Operator surface has no `dry_run` â€” every action is destructive on first click.
- Per-failure-class playbooks copy the same generic text â€” useless when on-call needs class-specific moves.
- "Mitigation = restart the service." Doesn't address any AI-specific class.
- No verification step. Switch was flipped, signal still firing, on-call walks away.
- Runbook says "consult the AI team" â€” no specific human, no contact path, no escalation tree.

## Outputs

- Universal first-N-minute playbook (deliverable: `docs/runbooks/ai-incident-first-n.md`).
- Per-failure-class playbooks.
- Mitigation primitive specs with operator surfaces.
- Containment verification checklist.

## Â§1 Universal Playbook

See `references/first-five-first-thirty-first-two.md` for the full timeline. Summary:

- **0â€“5 min** â€” acknowledge, open incident channel, capture the four facts (deploy log, provider status, index version, alert payload), assign roles (incident-commander, ops-lead, comms-lead, scribe). Pull the trace bundle.
- **5â€“30 min** â€” classify via triage tree, execute first mitigation, verify containment, post first status-page entry, notify regulated tenants if applicable.
- **30â€“120 min** â€” root-cause hypothesis, second-level mitigation if first didn't hold, prepare recovery plan, full evidence bundle captured, regulator notification window check.
- **2h+** â€” hand off to recovery; postmortem opened.

## Â§2 Per-Failure-Class Playbooks

Each class has its own playbook with: detection signal, first mitigation, second mitigation, comms posture, evidence to capture, recovery handoff. See `references/per-failure-class-playbooks.md` for full text. Classes:

1. **hallucination-spike** â€” first move: `abstain-mode` on the affected feature (raise abstain threshold so the system refuses rather than fabricates); second move: prompt-rollback or model-pin to last-known-good.
2. **prompt-drift** â€” first move: prompt-rollback to last-known-good prompt version via gateway prompt-pin.
3. **model-regression** â€” first move: model-pin to last-known-good model version; second: route to fallback provider.
4. **jailbreak** â€” first move: tighten safety classifier threshold + add the jailbreak pattern to the deny-list; second: rotate any leaked credentials/data; third: regulator/customer notification if data exfil confirmed.
5. **cost-runaway** â€” first move: per-tenant quota cap (or per-feature) to halt bleed; second: identify cause (loop, prompt bloat, price change, fallback misfire) and apply targeted fix.
6. **agent-action incident** â€” first move: agent kill-switch (pause all in-flight tasks for the affected feature/tenant); second: undo reversible actions, document irreversible ones; third: customer + (if applicable) regulator notification.
7. **retrieval-drift** â€” first move: index-pin to the last-known-good index snapshot; second: pause ingest pipeline if data is corrupting; third: rebuild index from clean source.
8. **training-data-shift / data-evolution** â€” first move: abstain-mode on affected slices; second: ingest schema validation; third: rolling fix in pipeline.
9. **provider-incident** â€” first move: activate fallback chain (gateway routing pin to next provider); second: degrade gracefully (read-only-mode if dependent feature can't fall back).
10. **tool-vendor outage / schema change** â€” first move: tool-disable for affected feature (agent stops calling it); second: vendor liaison opens ticket; third: schema-mismatch detection-tightening.

## Â§3 Mitigation Primitives

These are the operator-facing surfaces every runbook depends on. They must exist *before* any incident occurs.

| Primitive | What it does | Where it lives | Propagation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **kill-switch** (feature) | Stops the feature entirely; returns a "feature unavailable" message. | `ai-model-gateway` + back-office | < 60s |
| **kill-switch** (agent task) | Pauses one in-flight agent task; cancels remaining steps. | `ai-agents-tools` runtime | immediate |
| **abstain-mode** | Raises abstain threshold; system answers fewer queries, refuses more. | per-feature config in gateway | < 60s |
| **read-only-mode** | Disables write actions for feature/agent; reads still served. | per-feature config | < 60s |
| **model-pin** | Forces a specific model version for a feature; ignores tier-based routing. | gateway | < 60s |
| **prompt-pin** | Forces a specific prompt version for a feature. | gateway | < 60s |
| **index-pin** | Forces a specific retrieval index snapshot. | retrieval service | < 60s |
| **tool-pin** | Forces a specific tool version / disables the tool. | agent runtime | < 60s |
| **gateway routing pin** | Forces a specific provider/region. | gateway | < 60s |
| **per-tenant feature pause** | Disables the feature only for the affected tenant(s). | gateway + entitlements | < 60s |
| **quota cap** | Per-tenant or per-feature hard cap on tokens/cost/requests. | gateway | < 60s |
| **full feature rollback** | Reverts the feature flag to previous variant for everyone. | feature-flag platform | < 60s |

Every primitive logs `(actor, timestamp, primitive, scope, reason, ticket_id)` to `ai_incident_mitigation_log`. Reason is mandatory â€” no anonymous flips.

## Â§4 Containment Verification

Containment is **proven by signal**, not by switch flip. For each mitigation:

| Mitigation | Verification check | Time |
|---|---|---|
| abstain-mode | abstain rate rises in 10 min to expected level; faithfulness recovers | 15 min |
| model-pin | model_version label in traces matches the pinned value | 5 min |
| prompt-pin | prompt_version label in traces matches the pinned value | 5 min |
| index-pin | index_version label in retrieval spans matches | 5 min |
| kill-switch (feature) | feature-call rate drops to ~0 | 2 min |
| kill-switch (agent task) | in-flight task count drops to 0 for scope | immediate |
| gateway routing pin | provider distribution shifts as expected | 5 min |
| quota cap | per-tenant cost rate plateaus | 15 min |

If containment doesn't verify within target, the mitigation failed. Move to second-level mitigation in the per-class playbook. Do **not** flip a second switch and walk away.

## Â§5 Anti-Patterns

- Mitigation primitives exist in code but no operator UI â€” on-call writes SQL or runs ad-hoc scripts at 02:14.
- Containment is "I flipped the switch, signal looked better for a minute" â€” without a defined verification check.
- Per-class playbooks copy-pasted from a generic platform incident template.
- No handoff into recovery; incident closed when signal recovers, leaving the rollback as the new permanent state.
- Comms not part of the runbook â€” operator focuses on tech, customers find out from Twitter.
- Mitigation primitive log isn't structured â€” postmortem cannot reconstruct what was flipped when.

## Â§6 SLA-Impact Incident Class (Enhancement)

In addition to the standard incident classes (latency / error / safety / cost / security), agent-stack operations introduce an **SLA-impact** class. The class is asserted by the IC during triage and triggers the **auto-credit-issuance branch** during the incident.

### What qualifies as an SLA-impact incident

| Pattern | SLA-impact? |
|---|---|
| Resolution rate drops > 20% from baseline for > 15 min on a tenant whose tier commits a floor | Yes |
| TTR p95 doubles for > 30 min on a tier with a TTR commitment | Yes |
| Single irreversible-action escape | Yes (zero-target â€” always) |
| Kill-switch response > committed RTO | Yes |
| Feature-availability for a metered agent feature < SLO for > 5 min | Yes |
| Internal SLO miss with no customer-observable impact | No |
| Cost spike contained without customer effect | No |

The IC declares SLA-impact via a structured field in the incident record (`incident.sla_impact = true`, plus `incident.affected_tenants` and `incident.commitment_dimension`).

### The auto-credit branch

Once declared, the runbook adds three obligations:

1. **Evidence pack snapshot** â€” at incident start, dump the trace bundle, the success-tracking counters, and the relevant SLOs for the affected tenants. This pack becomes the input to the SLA-credit pipeline (`ai-agent-sla-credit-automation`).
2. **Mass-credit posture** â€” for incidents affecting > 5 tenants, the runbook switches from per-tenant credit issuance to **mass-credit mode**: a single decision in the back-office (`saas-admin-backoffice-tooling`) applies the credit formula to every affected tenant simultaneously, with one combined audit-log row.
3. **Customer comms gating** â€” the SLA-credit notification email **must not** be sent before the Stripe credit-note has acknowledged. Race condition: customer receives "we credited you $X" and the credit doesn't appear in the dashboard. Mitigation: send the public-status update first, then the per-tenant credit emails after the credit-note webhook has fired.

### Incident â†’ credit handoff payload

When the IC declares an SLA-impact incident, the runbook publishes:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "INC-2026-05-12-014",
  "declared_at": "2026-05-12T10:18:00Z",
  "sla_impact": true,
  "affected_features": ["support_copilot"],
  "affected_tenants_query": "tier in ('business','enterprise') and feature_used('support_copilot') in window",
  "commitment_dimension": "resolution_rate_floor",
  "breach_window": {"start": "2026-05-12T10:00", "end": null},
  "evidence_pack_uri": "s3://incidents/INC-2026-05-12-014/evidence/",
  "credit_formula_ref": "sla-class-table.md#business_tier"
}
```

`ai-agent-sla-credit-automation` subscribes to this signal and opens credit cases automatically â€” gated by its own eligibility-rules pipeline (`eligibility-rules.md`).

### Cross-links
