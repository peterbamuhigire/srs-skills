# AI Agent Observability and Replay

<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- Designing the **trace schema for agent tasks** (one trace = one task; sub-spans = steps; sub-sub-spans = LLM call, tool call).
- Wiring tool I/O capture so support can see exactly what the agent did in < 2 minutes.
- Building **deterministic replay** so a recorded task can be re-run with a new prompt/model/tool version.
- Building "what would the agent do differently" debugging â€” given a trace, run it through a candidate config and surface the diff.
- Wiring the agent inbox and admin console to per-task traces.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is single-request AI observability â€” `ai-observability-and-debugging`.
- The task is the eval pipeline â€” `ai-eval-harness`, `ai-agent-eval`.
- The task is general OTel setup â€” `observability-monitoring`.

## Required Inputs

- Agent runtime emitting spans per step (`ai-agent-runtime-architecture`).
- LLM gateway emitting cost+tokens per call (`ai-model-gateway`).
- Tool registry (`ai-agent-tool-catalogue-and-action-gating`).
- Trace backend (Honeycomb/Tempo/Jaeger), logs backend, dashboard tool.

## Workflow

1. Read this `SKILL.md`.
2. Define the **agent trace schema** (Â§1). See `references/trace-schema-agent.md`.
3. Implement **per-step span emission** in the runtime (Â§2).
4. Implement **tool I/O capture** with sensitive-field redaction (Â§3).
5. Build the **task viewer** in the admin console (Â§4).
6. Build **deterministic replay** (Â§5).
7. Build "**what would the agent do differently**" debugging (Â§6).
8. Wire **task-level dashboards** (Â§7).
9. Apply anti-patterns (Â§8).

## Quality Standards

- Every agent task has exactly one parent trace; every step is a child span; every LLM call and every tool call is a sub-span of its step.
- Tool I/O is captured for every call. Sensitive fields are redacted at capture; raw values are never persisted in trace storage.
- The task viewer renders a complete task in < 3 seconds for tasks up to 100 steps.
- Deterministic replay reproduces the original tool I/O exactly; LLM calls are seeded where provider supports.
- "What would the agent do differently" diff highlights step-level divergence: same input, different tool chosen, different args, different terminal state.
- Task-level dashboards answer: which features fail most, which tenants are most expensive, which tools fail most often, what's the median time-to-completion.

## Anti-Patterns

- One span "agent.task" with no breakdown. Useless for debugging.
- Tool args captured in plaintext including PII / secrets. Trace store becomes a compliance liability.
- Replay calls live tools. Charges real cards.
- "Show me why" surface that just dumps the LLM's chain-of-thought. Not enough; need the structured trace.
- Trace storage with no retention policy. GDPR exposure; unbounded cost.
- Task-level dashboards aggregate across tenants only; no drill into a single task.
- Per-step spans missing `tool.version` and `prompt.version`. Replay impossible.

## Outputs

- OTel trace schema for agent tasks.
- Per-step span emission in the runtime.
- Tool I/O capture + redaction.
- Task viewer (admin / support).
- Deterministic replay implementation.
- "What would differ" debugger.
- Task-level dashboards.

## Â§1 Trace Schema

```
trace: agent.task
  span: agent.task                        (root)
    attributes:
      agent.task.id, agent.tenant.id, agent.feature, agent.model_pin,
      agent.prompt.version, agent.tool_set.version, agent.steps.budget,
      agent.steps.used, agent.usd.total, agent.terminal.state
    span: agent.step.0
      attributes: state_before, state_after, step.index
      span: agent.llm.plan
        attributes: model, tokens_in, tokens_out, usd, latency_ms
      span: agent.tool.{tool_name}
        attributes: tool.version, args.hash, status, latency_ms, usd, idempotency_key
    span: agent.step.1
      ...
```

Convention: span names are stable strings; attribute keys are dotted; redaction is applied at attribute set time.

Full schema in `references/trace-schema-agent.md`.

## Â§2 Per-Step Span Emission

```python
def run_step(task):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span(f"agent.step.{task.steps_used}") as step:
        step.set_attribute("step.index", task.steps_used)
        step.set_attribute("state_before", task.state)
        plan = call_planner(task)
        step.set_attribute("plan.kind", plan.kind)
        if plan.kind == "tool_call":
            result = execute_tool(plan.tool, plan.args, task)
            step.set_attribute("tool.name", plan.tool)
            step.set_attribute("tool.version", registry.get(plan.tool).version)
            step.set_attribute("tool.args.hash", hash_args(plan.args))
            step.set_attribute("tool.status", result["status"])
        elif plan.kind == "final":
            step.set_attribute("response.length", len(plan.response))
        step.set_attribute("state_after", task.state)
```

## Â§3 Tool I/O Capture and Redaction

Tool args and observations are captured to a separate store (not the trace attributes â€” they would blow attribute size limits and leak):

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_tool_io (
  id              BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id         BIGINT NOT NULL,
  step_index      INT NOT NULL,
  tenant_id       BIGINT NOT NULL,
  tool_name       VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
  args_redacted   JSON NOT NULL,
  observation_redacted JSON NOT NULL,
  args_hash       CHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  retained_until  DATETIME NOT NULL,
  INDEX (task_id, step_index)
);
```

Redaction rules:

| Pattern | Redaction |
|---|---|
| Email-shaped field (`to`, `email`, `cc`) | `<EMAIL_HASH:xxxx>` |
| Card / bank-account-shaped | `<PAN_HASH:xxxx>` |
| Long free text in `body`, `message`, `notes` | Keep first 500 chars + length; rest replaced with `<TRUNCATED>` |
| Custom PII-tagged fields (per schema annotation) | Replace with `<REDACTED>` |
| Customer IDs | Keep (needed for support) |

Retention: 90 days default. Configurable per tenant (Enterprise can ask for longer; legal hold extends).

```

Filterable, searchable. Linked from support ticket â†’ trace.

## Â§5 Deterministic Replay

Given a `task_id`, re-execute the task with the same or a candidate config:

```python
def replay(task_id, candidate=None, mock_tools=True):
    original = load_full_trace(task_id)
    runtime = build_runtime(
        prompt_version=candidate.prompt if candidate else original.prompt_version,
        model_pin=candidate.model if candidate else original.model_pin,
        tool_runtime=ReplayToolRuntime(original.steps) if mock_tools else live_tool_runtime,
        budgets=original.budgets,
    )
    new_trace = runtime.run(original.goal, ctx=original.context)
    return diff(original, new_trace)
```

`mock_tools=True` is mandatory in production replay UI â€” never re-execute side effects.

LLM calls use the provider's `seed` parameter where supported. Non-determinism residual (top-k sampling) is acceptable; replay aims for "close enough for diagnosis".

## Â§6 "What Would Differ" Debugger

A side-by-side view:

```
Original (trace tsk_abc)          | Candidate (prompt v2.4)
----------------------------------|----------------------------------
Step 1: charge_lookup(1234)       | Step 1: charge_lookup(1234)
Step 2: charge_lookup(1235)       | Step 2: charge_lookup(1235)
Step 3: kb_search("refund")       | Step 3: payment_refund(1235, 89)  âš  off-script irreversible
Step 4: payment_refund(1235, 89)  | (terminal â€” completed in 3 steps)
Step 5: respond(...)              |
```

Highlights:
- Step-level alignment by canonical signature.
- Off-script irreversibles flagged red.
- Step count delta.
- Cost delta.
- Final response diff (text diff).

This is the engineering surface for prompt-tuning, model upgrades, and tool changes.

## Â§7 Task-Level Dashboards

| Dashboard | What it answers |
|---|---|
| Feature health | Per-feature success rate, intervention rate, median cost, p90 cost over time |
| Tenant cost (agent share) | Per-tenant agent cost / total AI cost; outliers |
| Tool reliability | Per-tool error rate, p90 latency, budget-block rate |
| Trajectory length | Distribution of steps used per feature; outliers |
| Approval flow | Approval rate, time-to-decide median, edit rate per feature |
| Failure modes | Top reasons for FAILED / BUDGET_EXCEEDED / ABANDONED |

Every dashboard links into the task viewer for drill-down.

## Â§8 Anti-Patterns

- Single span per task. Cannot diagnose.
- Tool args in plaintext. PII / cards in traces.
- Replay calls live tools. Charges customers in support sessions.
- Task viewer that times out on tasks with > 50 steps. Long-running tasks become opaque.
- No retention policy on traces. Cost + compliance disaster.
- "Show me why" surface that's just the LLM's chain-of-thought, no tool spans. Misleading.
- Dashboards that aggregate without drill-down. Trends without diagnosis.

## Â§9 Task-Success Evidence as a First-Class Trace Field (Enhancement)

The trace bundle is the **evidence pack** the SLA credit pipeline, the dispute-resolution flow, and the auditor all read. Task-success evidence is not a side artifact â€” it lives in the trace.

### Required trace fields

Every task trace adds these top-level fields once the success-tracking cascade has produced a verdict:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `task.success.verdict` | enum | `resolved` / `failed` / `attempted_only` / `abandoned` |
| `task.success.verdict_source` | enum | `heuristic` / `llm_judge` / `human_verifier` |
| `task.success.confidence` | float | 0.0â€“1.0 (judge output) |
| `task.success.evidence_ref` | string | URI to the evidence JSON in object storage |
| `task.success.policy_version` | string | success-contract version pinned for the verdict |
| `task.success.verdict_at` | ISO-8601 | when the verdict was finalized |
| `task.success.disputed` | bool | true if a dispute is currently open |
| `task.success.dispute_outcome` | enum / null | `upheld` / `overturned` / `pending` |
| `task.success.refund_event_id` | string / null | if a refund was issued |
| `task.success.sla_credit_event_id` | string / null | if a credit was issued |

### The evidence JSON

`evidence_ref` points to an immutable object (S3 / GCS with object lock) containing:

```json
{
  "task_id": "...",
  "verdict": "resolved",
  "verdict_source": "llm_judge",
  "judge_model": "claude-opus-4-7@2026-04",
  "judge_prompt_hash": "sha256:...",
  "evidence_inputs": {
    "user_goal": "...",
    "agent_final_response": "...",
    "tool_calls_summary": "...",
    "heuristic_signals": { "user_replied_thanks": true, "no_followup_24h": true }
  },
  "judge_output": { "verdict": "resolved", "rationale": "...", "confidence": 0.92 },
  "human_override": null,
  "created_at": "2026-05-12T10:14:09Z"
}
```

### Why it lives in the trace

- **Disputes:** the customer (or CS rep) opens the trace and sees the *exact* reasoning that produced the verdict.
- **SLA credits:** the credit-issuance pipeline (`ai-agent-sla-credit-automation`) embeds the `evidence_ref` in the audit-log row, so 18 months later an auditor can reconstruct *why* a credit was issued.
- **Regulator retention:** for financial-services tenants the evidence pack is part of the 7-year retention scope (SOX) or 10-year (MiFID II).

### Retention

- `task.success.evidence_ref` objects retain for **min(tenant_policy, regulatory_floor)**.
- The trace itself may be aged out to cheaper storage; the evidence JSON stays in the original bucket.
- Object-lock prevents tampering between verdict and dispute deadline.

### Cross-links

- `ai-agent-task-success-tracking` â€” produces the verdict and the evidence ref.
- `ai-agent-sla-credit-automation/references/credit-issuance-pipeline.md` â€” consumes the evidence ref.
- `ai-agent-revenue-recognition/references/month-end-close-pipeline.md` â€” requires `verdict_ref` on every revenue line.

## Replay Availability as Compliance Evidence (Enhancement)

Replay availability is an auditable control for SOC 2 **Availability (A1.3, recovery)** and **Processing Integrity (PI1.5, re-processing)** and for ISO 27001 **A.12.4 (logging) + A.17.1 (continuity)**.

A monthly **replay-availability test** picks a random sample of N=50 historical tasks (stratified by tool class and tenant) and re-runs them through the replay harness. Pass criteria:

- 100% of tasks resolve to a deterministic trajectory or to a documented non-determinism reason (provider-side randomness, retired tool).
- Median replay latency â‰¤ 1.5Ã— the original task latency.
- No replay attempt fails to fetch prompt registry / tool registry state at task time.

The test emits an evidence pack:

```
evidence/availability/replay/{YYYY-MM}/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”œâ”€â”€ sample.jsonl                # the 50 sampled tasks
â”œâ”€â”€ replay-results.jsonl        # per-task: deterministic / drifted / unreplayable
â”œâ”€â”€ latency-distribution.json
â”œâ”€â”€ attestation.txt
â””â”€â”€ signature.sig
```

Cadence: monthly, recorded in `ops/compliance/evidence-cadence.yaml` as `availability_replay_test`. Failed runs open a `high` exception against A1.3 and PI1.5.

Cross-links: `ai-agent-soc2-controls` (A1.3, PI1.5), `ai-agent-iso27001-controls` (A.12.4, A.17.1), `ai-agent-evidence-automation`, `ai-agent-control-testing-and-attestation`.
