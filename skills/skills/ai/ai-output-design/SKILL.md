<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- Designing any AI output surface — chat bubbles, result panels, document drafts, canvas artifacts.
- The deliverable needs structure, verifiability, grounding, forward-actions, or inline refinement.

## Do Not Use When

- Designing the chrome around AI (loading, streaming, confidence states on input side) — use `ai-ux-patterns`.
- Designing long-running agent control primitives — use `ai-agentic-ui`.

## Required Inputs

- The output shape (prose, list, table, code, image, plan).
- The durability of the output: ephemeral (chat) or artifact (canvas).
- The source material the output will cite (if any).
- Available refinement controls and forward actions.

## Workflow

- Read this `SKILL.md` first, then load referenced deep-dives as needed.
- Apply the five principles in order; each failure mode maps to one principle.
- Decide canvas vs chat using the decision matrix.
- Draft the output template system prompt block.
- Specify source attribution, grounding metadata, forward actions, and inline refinement.

## Quality Standards

- No confidence-percentage UI on LLM outputs. Ever.
- Every factual claim carries an inline source.
- Every output surface has 2–4 forward-action affordances.
- Refinement is inline; user never re-prompts from scratch.

## Anti-Patterns

- Confidence badges on LLM outputs (false authority).
- Unstructured wall of prose.
- Sources dumped at the bottom with no inline anchoring.
- Chat used for durable artifacts; canvas used for ephemeral chat.

## Outputs

- Output-template system prompt block.
- Source-attribution component spec.
- Grounding metadata component spec.
- Forward-action affordance list.
- Inline-refinement menu spec.
- Canvas-vs-chat decision for each AI feature.

## Why AI Outputs Fail

Most AI output surfaces fail for one of five reasons:

- Unstructured slab of prose — **Clear fail**.
- No way to verify claims — **Verifiable fail**.
- User can't tell what context the AI used — **Grounded fail**.
- Reading ends with a dead end — **Actionable fail**.
- Any refinement requires re-prompting from scratch — **Adjustable fail**.

The five principles below map to fixes for each.

---

## Principle 1 — Clear

Every output has a structure template in the system prompt. Enforce structure but use the **leanest template that works**; over-styling suppresses flexibility.

**Baseline template:**

```
Title -> Intro (1-2 sentences) -> Key Concepts -> Steps (if procedural) -> Notes (caveats) -> Sources
```

UI side: render the template as collapsible sections when long; preserve the sections on copy/export.

---

## Principle 2 — Verifiable

**REJECT confidence-percentage UI for LLMs.** LLMs are bad at self-confidence; internal token probabilities do not map to truth. A "87% confident" badge on a hallucinated answer is worse than no badge — it confers false authority.

**Instead: inline sources per claim.** Perplexity superscript pattern. Each claim links to a specific passage in a source. Multiple claims without sources is a structural smell.

**Exceptions where a confidence number IS OK:**

- Calibrated non-LLM models (a CV model that reports softmax).
- RAG retrieval score (distinct from LLM self-assessment).
- A/B test predictions with real backtests.

See `references/verifiability-patterns.md`.

---

## Principle 3 — Grounded

Users trust an output when they know **the lens the model used**. Surface:

- Model + version ("Codex Sonnet 4.6").
- Agent / tool used ("Used Web Search").
- Locale / jurisdiction ("Answer framed for UK law").
- Mode ("Fast mode vs Thinking mode").
- Session history ("Based on 3 earlier docs in this chat").

Implement as a "Why we suggested this" affordance — one click expands the grounding metadata.

---

## Principle 4 — Actionable (Forward Verbs)

The output is not the goal; the action after the output is. Design the onward journey. Every output surface should expose obvious forward affordances:

- Save / Export.
- Buy / Book / Register.
- Cite / Quote.
- Navigate to related.
- Refine (see Adjustable).

Rule: a response that ends "…and that's it" without an action button is a design failure. Default to 2–4 forward affordances even for pure Q&A (copy, save, share, refine).

---

## Principle 5 — Adjustable (Inline Refinement Beats Re-prompt)

- **On-select UI** (Notion pattern): user highlights text → inline menu: "Shorter / Longer / Simpler / Formal / Translate". Runs a scoped prompt on just the selection. The user does not type a new prompt.
- **Prompt augmentation** (Elaborate button): user clicks "Elaborate" → system appends a directive to the last prompt and re-runs. Avoids re-prompt-from-scratch.
- **Knobs** (QuillBot Fluency/Formal sliders): exposed as persistent controls above the output. Changing them regenerates.
- **Version selector** (Codex Artifacts pattern): every regeneration is a versioned sibling, not a destructive overwrite. Users compare and pick.

See `references/inline-refinement.md`.

## Canvas vs Chat Selection

Two distinct output paradigms.

| Paradigm | When to use | Prescriptions |
|---|---|---|
| Chat | Ephemeral Q&A, conversational iteration, short outputs | Linear transcript, streaming tokens, recent history visible |
| Canvas | Output is durable artifact (doc, plan, image, code) — shareable, storable, returnable | Editable workspace, version history (Codex Artifacts), undo/redo, node-based iteration for generative media (Runway) |

Rule: move output to canvas the moment it becomes shareable. A 3-page policy draft in chat is friction; the same draft in canvas is a deliverable.

See `references/canvas-vs-chat.md`.

---

## Starter Prompts as Positioning

Starter prompts are not examples — they are product positioning. Generic starters ("Write a poem about autumn") are lazy. Good starters reflect the product's specific integrations, tone, and differentiators. Make them **context-aware**: Monday-morning vs Friday-afternoon, document-type-open-in-editor, user-plan-tier.

---

## Output Template System Prompt Snippet (Drop-in)

```
Structure every response as:
1. One-sentence title
2. 1-2 sentence introduction
3. Key concepts as a bulleted list if appropriate
4. Step-by-step instructions if procedural
5. Notes section for caveats, limits, or edge cases
6. Sources section with inline citations
If a section has no content, omit it.
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Confidence-percentage badges on LLM outputs (false authority).
- Unstructured wall of prose with no headings.
- Sources listed at the bottom with no inline anchoring.
- Output ends with no next-action affordance.
- Refinement requires user to re-type the prompt.
- Over-styled template so rigid that edge cases render badly.
- Canvas used for ephemeral chat or chat used for durable artifacts.
