# Project Brief

## Summary

This repository is a curated AI skills and documentation engine. It helps
coding agents and human operators select reusable workflows for software
engineering, AI systems, SaaS operations, finance doctrine, mobile development,
security, UX, and SDLC documentation.

## Primary Users

| User | Need |
| --- | --- |
| Coding agents | Fast skill discovery, accurate routing, concise execution rules. |
| Developers | Reusable implementation guidance and quality gates. |
| Product and operations teams | Product, SaaS, documentation, and governance playbooks. |
| Finance implementers | Canonical accounting, controls, close, audit, and reporting doctrine. |

## Outcomes

- Reduce repeated prompt and documentation work.
- Keep domain rules close to execution guidance.
- Maintain a skill catalog that is small enough to route reliably, with routing
  precision measured (not assumed) and guarded in CI.
- Turn agent output into production-grade work a team can maintain: every
  meaningful change carries a Delivery Definition of Done pack (tests, release,
  rollback, runbook, maintenance notes).
- Preserve deep references without making every skill entrypoint heavy.
- Support Windows, Ubuntu, and Debian consumers with portable Markdown and
  Python tooling.

## Non-Goals

- This is not a deployable application.
- This repository does not expose an HTTP API.
- This repository does not own a database schema.
- This repository should not be treated as a package registry without an
  explicit release workflow.

## Current Risks

- The active skill count is 173, three above the 150-170 soft target; future
  additions need alias discipline. The CI guardrail (200 hard cap) and the
  collision detector keep this from becoming routing noise.
- Inactive aliases must stay documented in `docs/skill-aliases.yml`; the
  alias-integrity check now fails CI on a stale or unrouted alias, so this is
  caught automatically rather than by memory.
- New skills can shadow a neighbour's routing. Add a fixture to
  `scripts/routing_fixtures.yml` for any skill a sibling could steal traffic
  from, so the smoke test guards it.
