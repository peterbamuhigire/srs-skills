# Skills Repository Overview

This repository is a working catalog of reusable AI-assistant skills and
supporting documentation. It combines implementation guidance, product strategy,
security patterns, finance doctrine, mobile development guidance, SDLC
documentation templates, and catalog maintenance tooling.

## What Is Here

| Area | Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main skill catalog | `skills/` | Broad software, AI, SaaS, mobile, security, UX, and product skills. |
| Finance doctrine | `doctrine/skills/` | Canonical accounting, audit, reporting, IFRS, controls, and close guidance. |
| SDLC initialization | `00-meta-initialization/` | Entry-point project documentation workflow and examples. |
| Routing docs | `docs/skill-routing-index.md` | Human-readable consolidation and routing policy. |
| Alias data | `docs/skill-aliases.yml` | Machine-readable skill alias map. |
| Maintenance scripts | `scripts/` | Guardrail validator, routing smoke test, and setup helpers. |
| CI gates | `.github/workflows/skill-guardrails.yml` | Runs the guardrails and routing smoke test on every push and PR. |
| Integrator + client docs | `docs/USING-IN-A-PROJECT.md`, `docs/CLIENT-VALUE-BRIEF.md` | How to apply the catalogue in a real repo; plain-language client value. |
| Long-form references | `book-extractions/`, `claude-guides/`, `blog-posts/` | Source material and companion writing. |

## How To Work In This Repo

1. Identify the relevant skill or routing entry.
2. Read the skill `SKILL.md` and only the references needed for the task.
3. Keep skill frontmatter concise and accurate.
4. Update routing docs when a parent skill absorbs or supersedes another skill.
5. Run both gates before finishing catalog maintenance (CI runs the same two):

   ```powershell
   python -X utf8 scripts\skill_catalog_guardrails.py --report-only
   python -X utf8 scripts\routing_smoke_test.py --report-only
   ```

## Current Catalog Policy

- Active roots are `skills/`, `doctrine/skills/`, and `00-meta-initialization/`.
- Target active catalog size is 150-170 skills.
- The guardrail hard cap is 200 active `SKILL.md` files.
- Finance doctrine is canonical in `doctrine/skills/`.
- Current active catalog size is 173 skills (collision-checked: 0 true duplicates).
- Inactive aliases are retained as `ALIAS.md` and routed through
  `docs/skill-aliases.yml`.
- Duplicate finance entrypoints under `skills/finance/` have been deactivated
  and route to canonical `doctrine/skills/` targets.

## Enforced Invariants

The catalogue is a gated engine, not just a document set. Two scripts run in CI
(`.github/workflows/skill-guardrails.yml`) and fail the build on:

- duplicate frontmatter names, over-cap active count, oversized `SKILL.md`,
  over-length descriptions, malformed frontmatter;
- broken `references/`/`templates/` links and stale or dangling aliases;
- a fixtured routing task whose expected skill drifts out of its top matches
  (routing precision is measured, not assumed).

Meaningful implementation work also carries a Delivery Definition of Done pack
(`skills/sdlc-meta/skill-composition-standards/references/delivery-definition-of-done.md`):
tests, release plan, rollback plan, runbook, and maintenance notes, so output is
operable by a team that did not write it.
