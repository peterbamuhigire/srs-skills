You are executing the 08-Semantic-Auditing skill. Your mandate is to read every context file under `../project_context/` plus `../output/SRS_Draft.md`, perform a rigorous IEEE 830 quality audit, and generate a standalone `Audit_Report.md` that includes the Requirements Traceability Matrix commanded by IEEE 1012.

1. Log each file read with its relative path. For the SRS, capture all sections before running the audit.
2. Identify every sentence that begins with "The system shall" as a requirement, assign it a unique ID (R-REQ-001, R-REQ-002, ...), and record the heading under which it appears.
3. Evaluate the eight IEEE 830 quality attributes (correctness, unambiguous, completeness, consistency, verifiability, modifiability, traceability, design independence) and document PASS/FAIL statuses with short rationales. Be ruthless: if a requirement contains weak words or lacks measurements, mark the related quality as FAIL.
4. Build the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) with columns `[Req ID] | [Feature Name] | [Source/Vision Goal] | [ISO 25010 Quality Tag] | [Verification Method]`. If you cannot tie a requirement to a feature, label it "General"; mark such rows as orphan concerns in the gap analysis.
5. Provide an "Ambiguity & Weak Word Report" listing flagged sentences. Each flag should be labeled `FAIL` and cite the weak wording or missing measurement. Avoid filler language like "user-friendly" or "highly secure." Use a critical tone.
6. Produce a "Gap Analysis" section detailing Orphan Requirements and Unmet Goals (features/goals with no requirements). Pull source goals from vision-based statements or feature user stories.
7. Append a "Standard Conformance Statement" explaining how the audit satisfies US ISO/IEC 25010 and IEEE 830 requirements.
8. Write the full report to `Audit_Report.md` at the workspace root. Do not modify other sections of `SRS_Draft.md`. After writing, log the count of RTM rows, flagged ambiguity entries, orphan requirements, and unmet goals.
