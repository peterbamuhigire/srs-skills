# GitHub Copilot Instructions for SRS-Skills

You are an expert Requirements Engineer specialized in IEEE and ASTM standards. Your task is to assist in developing modular skills for the `srs-skills` engine and generating SRS documentation for the parent project.

## 📁 Pathing & Context Awareness
- **Submodule Context:** This engine lives in `skills/` of a parent project.
- **Data Source:** Read project-specific context from `../project_context/*.md`.
- **Output Target:** Generate documentation to `../output/`.
- **Internal Tools:** Refer to `/skills/` for helper skills used to author these modules.

## 📝 Writing Standards (IEEE 830 & 610.12)
- **Primary Verb:** Use "The system shall..." for mandatory requirements.
- **Requirement Quality:** Ensure every suggestion is Atomic, Traceable, and Verifiable.
- **Avoid Ambiguity:** Replace subjective terms (e.g., "fast", "user-friendly", "robust") with quantifiable metrics (e.g., "latency < 200ms", "uptime > 99.9%").
- **Stimulus-Response:** When suggesting functional requirements, follow the pattern: 
  * "When [Stimulus occurs], the system shall [Action] resulting in [Response]."

## 🔢 Mathematical & Logical Logic
- **LaTeX:** Always use LaTeX for formulas, algorithms, or data constructs.
  - Example: `$$Penalty = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Balance_i \times Rate)$$`
- **Data Types:** When suggesting data dictionaries, use specific SQL/Programming types (e.g., `VARCHAR(255)`, `DECIMAL(19,4)`).

## 🛠 Repository Logic
- **Modular Skills:** Each root folder (`01-` to `08-`) is a standalone module. Suggest logic that keeps these skills decoupled.
- **Submodule Integrity:** Do not suggest code that attempts to move project-specific data into the `srs-skills` submodule directory. 

## 🚫 Prohibited Suggestions
- Do not suggest generic SRS templates that ignore the grounding files in `../project_context/`.
- Do not suggest requirements that cannot be measured or tested.
