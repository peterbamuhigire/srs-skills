# ADR-0001 Postgres over MySQL

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-04-12

## Context

Livelink Health requires strong JSON support for clinical notes, row-level
security for multi-tenant isolation, and WAL-based physical replication for
the backup RPO target NFR-008.

## Decision

Adopt PostgreSQL 15 as the primary RDBMS. Use `pgcrypto` for field-level
encryption per CTRL-UG-002. Use streaming replication for DR with RPO
target of 15 minutes.

## Consequences

- Positive: mature RLS, strong JSONB performance, predictable WAL semantics.
- Negative: ops team needs Postgres-specific runbooks; retraining cost.
- Mitigated: runbook and monitoring already written for Postgres.

## Affects

- FR-001, FR-003, FR-013 (all write-path FRs that persist PII).
- NFR-004 (storage), NFR-005 (memory), NFR-008 (RPO).

# ADR-0002 Soft-delete with crypto-shredding for DPPA erasure

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-04-14

## Context

Uganda DPPA 2019 §30 grants data subjects a right to erasure. A physical
DELETE cascades through foreign keys and breaks audit chains required by
CTRL-UG-004. At the same time, "soft-delete with a flag" leaves plaintext
PII on disk, which violates CTRL-UG-002.

## Decision

Implement crypto-shredding: each patient record is encrypted with a
per-subject data encryption key (DEK). On erasure, destroy the DEK. The
ciphertext remains on disk as an opaque blob that no-one can decrypt. The
audit log chain is preserved.

## Consequences

- Positive: satisfies FR-011 erasure and retains FR-013 audit continuity.
- Positive: aligns with CTRL-UG-002 and CTRL-UG-004.
- Negative: key management complexity; requires HSM-backed DEK store.

## Affects

- FR-011 (erasure), FR-013 (audit log), CTRL-UG-002, CTRL-UG-004.

# CIA-001 Add MFA (TOTP) to provider login

- Status: approved
- Raised on: 2026-04-10
- Decision body: Livelink Steering Committee
- Decision date: 2026-04-12

## Context

A security review of CTRL-UG-004 flagged that provider login relied on
password-only authentication. The steering committee approved adding TOTP
MFA, creating FR-007 and adjusting the session design.

## Affected baseline IDs

- FR-007 (new)
- NFR-002 (availability budget for the MFA service)

## Downstream artifacts

- 03-design-documentation/threat-model.md
- 05-testing-documentation/test-plan/tc.md (TC-007)

## Rollback plan

If MFA causes login failures above 2%, disable the TOTP requirement via
feature flag `auth.require_totp=false` and page the on-call. Session tokens
minted before the flag flip remain valid. Restore within 15 minutes.
