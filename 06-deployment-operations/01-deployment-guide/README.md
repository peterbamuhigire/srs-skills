# 01-Deployment-Guide Skill

## Objective

This skill produces a step-by-step deployment guide that defines pre-deployment checklists, numbered deployment steps with exact commands, database migration procedures, rollback instructions, and post-deployment verification. It serves as the authoritative deployment reference for operations teams per IEEE 1062.

## Execution Steps

1. Verify `../output/HLD.md` and `../project_context/tech_stack.md` exist. Optionally check for `../output/Database_Design.md`. Halt if any required file is missing.
2. Invoke `logic.prompt` or trigger the skill. The skill generates pre-deployment checklists, deployment steps, rollback procedures, and post-deployment verification, then writes `../output/Deployment_Guide.md`.
3. Review the deployment steps to confirm each step includes exact commands, expected duration, and success criteria.
4. Proceed to `02-runbook` and `03-monitoring-setup` which can run in parallel once this skill completes.

## Quality Reminder

Every deployment step shall include the literal command or action to execute with expected duration. Every deployment guide shall include a complete rollback procedure that reverses deployment steps in order. Configuration shall distinguish dev, staging, and production environments explicitly. Flag deployment gaps rather than fabricating operational details.
