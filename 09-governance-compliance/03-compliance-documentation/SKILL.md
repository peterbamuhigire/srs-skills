# Compliance Documentation Skill

## Overview

This skill generates regulatory compliance documentation that maps project requirements, data handling practices, and architectural decisions to applicable regulatory frameworks. The skill assesses applicability of GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2, then produces detailed compliance mappings, gap analyses, and remediation roadmaps for each applicable framework. Only frameworks relevant to the project's domain and data classification are included.

## When to Use This Skill

- When the project handles personal data subject to GDPR
- When the project processes protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA
- When the project requires SOC2 attestation for service organization controls
- When stakeholders or clients require evidence of regulatory compliance posture
- When preparing for regulatory audits or third-party assessments
- When onboarding into regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government)

## Stimulus / Process / Response

- **Stimulus:** the consultant requests a compliance annex for a project whose `_registry/controls.yaml` has been populated with the applicable controls selected from the domain control library.
- **Process:** the skill hydrates the control library, joins it with the consultant's selection, gathers satisfying artifacts and verification test case IDs, and emits a deterministic per-control section.
- **Response:** a `Compliance_Docs.md` whose body sections are driven by the selected controls, each tied back to a regulatory anchor and an assigned reviewer; no free-text claims about frameworks that were not enumerated in `_context/quality-standards.md`.

## Core Instructions

1. The skill SHALL read `projects/<ProjectName>/_context/vision.md` to determine the project domain, target users, data subjects, and geographic scope. If the file is missing, halt execution and report the error.

2. The skill SHALL resolve the active domain from `projects/<ProjectName>/_context/domain.md`. If the file does not name one of the eight engine-recognized domains, halt and emit `[CONTEXT-GAP: domain]`.

3. The skill SHALL load `projects/<ProjectName>/_registry/controls.yaml` and extract every entry under `selected[]`. If the file is missing or `selected` is empty, halt and emit `[CONTEXT-GAP: controls.yaml]`. Each entry supplies the control `id`, the `applies_because` justification, and optional `owner` and `exemption` values.

4. The skill SHALL load `domains/<domain>/controls/control-register.yaml` and join each selected `id` to its `title`, `category`, `verification_kinds`, `minimum_evidence`, and `regulatory_anchor`. An `id` present in the selection but absent from the register SHALL be tagged `[V&V-FAIL: unknown_control]` and excluded from the output.

5. The skill SHALL load `domains/<domain>/controls/evidence-expectations.yaml` and, for each control's `category`, enumerate the expected artifact path patterns. The skill SHALL then scan the project workspace for artifacts matching each pattern (`fnmatch` on POSIX-normalized relative paths) and list the matching artifacts as the satisfying evidence. A pattern with no matching artifact SHALL be recorded in the Compliance Gap Analysis.

6. The skill SHALL load `projects/<ProjectName>/_registry/identifiers.yaml` and, for each selected control, extract every test case identifier (`TC-*`) that references the control `id` or is tagged with the control's `category`, and list those identifiers under the control's verification subsection.

7. The skill SHALL load `domains/<domain>/controls/required-reviews.yaml` and, for each control's `category`, record the `reviewer_role` and `cadence`. Controls whose category has no required-review entry SHALL be tagged `[REVIEWER-UNASSIGNED]`.

8. The skill SHALL perform a Regulatory Applicability Assessment grounded in `_context/quality-standards.md`. A framework is "in scope" only if its name appears (case-insensitive substring) in that file. Controls whose `regulatory_anchor.framework` is not in scope SHALL be excluded from the main body and listed in an appendix.

9. The skill SHALL classify all data elements identified in the project into categories: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted (or PII, PHI, PCI as applicable).

10. For each selected, in-scope control the skill SHALL emit a section containing (a) control `id` and `title`, (b) the `regulatory_anchor.framework` and `clause`, (c) the `applies_because` justification, (d) the satisfying artifacts listed under step 5, (e) the verification test case IDs listed under step 6, and (f) the assigned reviewer listed under step 7.

11. For each applicable framework, the skill SHALL generate a dedicated compliance section:
   - **GDPR:** Lawful basis for processing, data subject rights implementation, Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) triggers, data retention policies, cross-border transfer mechanisms
   - **HIPAA:** PHI identification, administrative/physical/technical safeguards, Business Associate Agreement (BAA) requirements, minimum necessary standard
   - **SOC2:** Trust Service Criteria mapping (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy)

12. The skill SHALL map security controls from the project architecture to regulatory requirements by loading `domains/<domain>/controls/obligations.yaml` and, for each in-scope obligation, listing the `satisfied_by` control IDs and whether each is present in the project selection.

13. The skill SHALL generate a Compliance Gap Analysis listing (a) obligations whose `framework` is in scope but for which no `satisfied_by` control is selected, (b) selected controls with no satisfying artifact, and (c) selected controls without a registered verification test case identifier.

14. The skill SHALL produce a Remediation Roadmap prioritizing compliance gaps by risk severity and regulatory deadline pressure.

15. The skill SHALL explicitly state when a framework is determined to be not applicable, with justification.

16. The skill SHALL avoid speculative compliance claims -- if insufficient information exists to assess a control, flag it as `[ASSESSMENT-PENDING]` rather than assuming compliance.

## Common Pitfalls

- Assuming all three frameworks apply without performing applicability assessment
- Making definitive compliance claims without sufficient architectural evidence
- Omitting data classification, which is the foundation for all compliance mapping
- Treating compliance as binary (compliant/non-compliant) without recognizing partial compliance states
- Ignoring cross-framework overlaps (e.g., GDPR and HIPAA both require access controls)
- Generating boilerplate compliance text that is not grounded in the actual project context

## Verification Checklist

1. Regulatory applicability is assessed and justified for each framework.
2. Data classification covers all data elements identified in the project.
3. Each applicable framework has a dedicated section with specific, grounded controls.
4. Non-applicable frameworks are explicitly excluded with justification.
5. Security controls are mapped to specific regulatory obligations.
6. Compliance gaps are identified with severity and remediation priority.
7. No speculative compliance claims exist -- uncertain items are tagged `[ASSESSMENT-PENDING]`.
8. The remediation roadmap is prioritized by risk and regulatory urgency.

## Integration

- **Upstream:** Consumes vision and quality standards from project context, and SRS/design artifacts from prior phases. Benefits from 02-audit-report findings.
- **Downstream:** Feeds external regulatory submissions and audit processes. Informs 04-risk-assessment compliance risk category.

## Standards Compliance

| Standard | Governs |
|----------|---------|
| GDPR (EU 2016/679) | Personal data processing, data subject rights, cross-border transfers |
| HIPAA (45 CFR Parts 160, 164) | Protected health information safeguards and BAA requirements |
| SOC2 (AICPA TSC) | Trust Service Criteria for service organizations |
