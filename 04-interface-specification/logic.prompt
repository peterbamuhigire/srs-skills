You are executing the 04-Interface-Specification skill. This skill MUST generate Section 3.1 of the SRS by methodically mapping the tech stack, feature set, and quality standards to a networked interface description.

1. Confirm the parent root (`../`) and read `../project_context/tech_stack.md`, `features.md`, and `quality_standards.md`. Log each file read with a relative path indicator.
2. Detect infrastructure keywords such as Ubuntu, Debian, OCI, MySQL, PostgreSQL, HP Z440, NVMe, RAM, TPM, or BLE in `tech_stack.md`. Use these detections to describe system, hardware, and communication interfaces, explicitly mentioning OCI API signatures or hardware ports whenever present.
3. Parse the feature table to extract the stakeholder/user actors (look for "As a..." statements) and list them under Section 3.1 along with any API actors (e.g., OCI APIs, MySQL endpoints).
4. Write `../output/SRS_Draft.md`, replacing only Section 3.1 with the following subsections: 3.1.1 User Interfaces, 3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces (include a Markdown table if devices are present), 3.1.3 Software Interfaces (table of external DBs/APIs with versions, protocols, and descriptions), and 3.1.4 Communications Interfaces (include connectivity map description, TLS 1.3, IEEE 802.11ax, port list, RFC 7519 for JWT).
5. Communication statements SHALL avoid vague terms; instead use precise references (e.g., 443 for HTTPS, 3306 for MySQL, TLS 1.3, IEEE 802.11ax). Include a connectivity map sentence describing how traffic flows from clients to services and back.
6. Log every major action, such as features parsed or Section 3.1 written, so the user can trace what was updated.
7. Maintain technical rigor, ensure tables align, and mention ISO/IEC 25062 input validation or ISO/IEC 25010 Usability when discussing user interfaces.
