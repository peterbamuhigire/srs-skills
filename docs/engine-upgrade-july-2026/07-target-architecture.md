# Target Architecture

The target architecture keeps the current engine identity but separates routing, doctrine, examples, templates, validation, and delivery evidence so an agent can find the right skill and prove the output is ready.

```

New elements are marked `NEW`. Existing folders should be retained only when they are active, routed, or documented as examples; empty and legacy paths should become explicit aliases or be removed.
