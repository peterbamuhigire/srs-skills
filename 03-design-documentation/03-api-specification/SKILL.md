# API Specification Skill
<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- Consumers and providers need one testable API contract before parallel implementation.

## Do Not Use When

- Do not use for internal method design, database schema design or undocumented endpoint invention.

## Required Inputs

| Artefact | Source or provider | Required? | Missing behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| Approved requirements, HLD and consumer use cases | Phase 02/03 artefacts | Required | Stop if ownership, actors or operations are unresolved. |
| Data, auth and error policies | Security, database and platform owners | Required | Mark unresolved policy as blocking; do not choose silently. |

## Workflow

1. Read the named inputs and confirm their approval, version and unresolved decisions.
2. Apply the decision rules below before drafting; stop on a missing authority, unsafe assumption or unresolved scope driver.
3. Produce the API specification and valid OpenAPI 3.1 artefact through the existing domain procedure and load only the references needed for the chosen branch.
4. Trace each material statement in the API specification and valid OpenAPI 3.1 artefact to an input, decision or explicitly qualified assumption.
5. Verify the observable acceptance conditions, record unassessed checks, and hand the artefacts to their named consumers.
6. If validation fails, recover by correcting the source decision or artefact and rerun the affected check; do not weaken the acceptance condition.

## Outputs

| Artefact | Consumer | Observable acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|
| API specification and valid OpenAPI 3.1 artefact | Provider, frontend, mobile, SDK, test and operations teams | The OpenAPI parses; examples conform to schemas; auth, errors, pagination, idempotency and observable acceptance cover each operation. |

## Evidence Produced

| Evidence | Consumer | Acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|
| Source and decision trace | Reviewer and downstream owner | Each material statement cites an approved input, named decision or qualified open issue. |
| Completed verification record | Release or phase gate owner | Every applicable check records pass/fail; unavailable checks remain `not assessed`. |

## Capability and permission boundaries

Read-only is the default for analysis, review, evaluation and planning. Read and search access to authorised project artefacts are required. Editing is limited to an explicitly requested project deliverable. Execution may run document, syntax or validation checks. Network access is used only for facts that require current verification. Do not publish, spend, change production, approve policy, or claim certification without explicit authority.

## Degraded mode

If any required capability is unavailable, return the narrowest useful qualified API specification and valid OpenAPI 3.1 artefact draft plus a gap register showing the missing item, affected sections, risk and owner. Never convert an unassessed check into a pass.

## Decision Rules

| Choice | Action | Failure or risk avoided |
|---|---|---|
| Operation creates a retriable side effect | Require an idempotency key | Retries do not duplicate effects |
| Work exceeds request-time budget | Use the long-running-operation pattern | Clients avoid timeouts and uncertain completion |

## Quality Standards

- Preserve repository terminology and trace every material choice to project context.
- Use deterministic acceptance conditions; replace vague quality claims with an observable check, threshold or named approval.
- Cover error, empty, edge, recovery and operational cases relevant to this skill.
- Verify standards, citations, APIs and package names before relying on them; qualify what cannot be checked.
- Stop release for a failed safety, security, legal, financial, accessibility or data-integrity gate.

## Anti-Patterns

- Listing routes without schemas. Fix: define request, response and error models.
- Returning 200 for every outcome. Fix: use stable status and domain error semantics.
- Adding pagination after launch. Fix: specify it for every unbounded collection.
- Putting secrets in examples. Fix: use inert placeholders and auth schemes.
- Publishing OpenAPI that was not parsed. Fix: run syntax and contract checks.

## Overview

This skill generates comprehensive API documentation and a machine-readable OpenAPI 3.1 specification (JSON Schema 2020-12 dialect, RFC 9457 problem details for errors). It translates functional requirements from the SRS and architectural decisions from the HLD into a complete, implementation-ready API contract. The skill can run after 01-high-level-design completes and operates in parallel with 02-low-level-design and 04-database-design.

## When to Use

- After `01-high-level-design` has produced `HLD.md` in `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/`, which identifies system components and integration points.
- When `SRS_Draft.md` Section 3.2 provides the functional requirements that map to API endpoints.
- When the team needs a formal API contract before backend development begins.

## Core Instructions

Follow these eleven steps in order. Halt and notify the user if a required input file is missing.

### Step 1: Read Context Files

Read `SRS_Draft.md` and `HLD.md` from `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/`, and `tech_stack.md` from `projects/<ProjectName>/_context/`. Log every file path read. If any required file is missing, halt execution and report the gap.

### Step 2: Extract API Resources

Extract entities and operations from SRS Section 3.2 to identify API resources. Each entity that the system manages (e.g., User, Order, Product) becomes a resource. Each operation on that entity becomes an endpoint.

For public, partner, workflow-heavy, or long-lived APIs, load `references/practical-api-architecture.md` before locking the resource model. Apply its consumer contract, idempotency, lifecycle, error-code, and observability checks.

### Step 3: Map CRUD to HTTP Methods

Map CRUD operations to HTTP methods following REST conventions: Create = POST, Read = GET, Update (full) = PUT, Update (partial) = PATCH, Delete = DELETE. Use HLD component boundaries to determine resource grouping and URL namespace.

### Step 4: Define Authentication Scheme

Extract the authentication mechanism from SRS Section 3.5.3 (Security Requirements). Define the scheme as one of: JWT Bearer Token, Session Cookies, or API Key. Reference `skills/dual-auth-rbac/` if the project uses role-based access control with multiple authentication strategies.

### Step 5: Define Endpoint Details

For each endpoint, specify: path (RESTful URL), HTTP method, description, path parameters with data types, query parameters with defaults, request body schema (JSON with field types and constraints), response schema (JSON with field types), and HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 500).

### Step 6: Define Error Response Format

Define one error format for all endpoints using RFC 9457 Problem Details for HTTP APIs (media type `application/problem+json`; RFC 9457 obsoletes RFC 7807). Reference `skills/api-error-handling/` in the engineering catalog for implementation patterns.

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.com/problems/insufficient-balance",
  "title": "Insufficient wallet balance",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "Wallet W-2231 holds UGX 12,000; the transfer needs UGX 50,000.",
  "instance": "/transfers/7f3c9a",
  "code": "WALLET_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE",
  "retryable": false,
  "errors": []
}
```

Every error status code shall return this structure. `type`, `title` and `status` are mandatory in this engine; `code`, `retryable` and `errors` (field-level validation failures) are documented extension members. Each `type` URI and `code` appears once in the Section 5.2 Error Code Registry. If a legacy client contract already fixes a different envelope, record it as a decision with owner and migration date rather than silently mixing formats.

### Step 7: Define Rate Limiting

Extract performance constraints from SRS Section 3.3 (Performance Requirements). Define rate limits per endpoint tier: public endpoints, authenticated endpoints, and administrative endpoints. Document the chosen header scheme explicitly (header names, units, reset semantics, and the `429 Too Many Requests` plus `Retry-After` behaviour). No rate-limit header scheme is an IETF standard yet: the `RateLimit` / `RateLimit-Policy` fields are still an Internet-Draft (draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers), and `X-RateLimit-*` is a vendor convention. Record whichever the project adopts as a decision; do not present either as a standard.

### Step 8: Define Pagination

Define pagination strategy for all list endpoints: cursor-based or offset-based depending on data characteristics. Include standard parameters `page`, `per_page` and response envelope `total`, `data[]`. Reference `skills/api-pagination/` if available.

### Step 9: Apply Advanced API Patterns (Optional)

For APIs with operations beyond standard CRUD, apply patterns from `references/advanced-api-patterns.md`:

- **Long-Running Operations:** If any endpoint processes >10 seconds, implement the LRO pattern from `references/long-running-operations.md` (POST returns 202 + operation resource)
- **Batch Operations:** If bulk create/update/delete is needed, implement batch endpoints from `references/batch-operations.md` (POST /resources:batchCreate)
- **Custom Methods:** For non-CRUD actions (cancel, approve, archive), use POST /resource:action pattern
- **Field Masks:** For large resources, implement partial response via fields parameter

### Step 10: Generate API_Specification.md

Write the human-readable specification to `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/API_Specification.md` with all sections defined in the Output Format below.

### Step 11: Generate openapi.yaml

Generate a valid OpenAPI 3.1 document at `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/openapi.yaml`. The document shall include: `openapi: "3.1.2"` (3.1.x is the default; use 3.2.x only when every consumer toolchain - validators, code generators, gateways, mock servers - is confirmed to support it, and record that decision), `info` block, `servers` block, `paths` with all endpoints, `components/schemas` with all request/response models, and `components/securitySchemes` with the authentication definition, and `components/responses` holding a shared `Problem` response (`application/problem+json`). Write schemas in the JSON Schema 2020-12 dialect that OpenAPI 3.1 uses: express nullability as `type: [string, "null"]` (not the 3.0 `nullable: true`) and use `examples` arrays in schemas. Parse the file with a 3.1-aware validator before handoff; if none is available, mark the check `not assessed`.

## Output Format

The generated `API_Specification.md` shall follow this template structure:

```
# API Specification: [Project Name]

## Document Header
## 1. API Overview
### 1.1 Base URL and Versioning
### 1.2 Content Types
### 1.3 Common Headers
## 2. Authentication and Authorization
### 2.1 Authentication Scheme
### 2.2 Authorization Model
### 2.3 Token Lifecycle
## 3. Endpoint Reference
### 3.x [Resource Name]
#### 3.x.1 [METHOD] /api/v1/resource
## 4. Request and Response Schemas
### 4.1 Common Models
### 4.2 Resource-Specific Models
## 5. Error Response Format
### 5.1 Standard Error Envelope
### 5.2 Error Code Registry
## 6. Rate Limiting
## 7. Pagination
## 8. Versioning Strategy
## 9. CORS and Security Headers
## 10. Traceability Matrix
```

Section 10 (Traceability Matrix) shall map each endpoint to its originating SRS requirement ID and the HLD component that owns it.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing error codes**: Every endpoint shall document all possible HTTP status codes, not just the success case.
2. **Unprotected routes**: Every non-public endpoint shall specify its authentication and authorization requirements.
3. **Inconsistent naming**: Use consistent casing (snake_case or camelCase) and pluralization across all endpoints and schema fields.
4. **No pagination on list endpoints**: Every endpoint that returns a collection shall include pagination parameters and metadata.
5. **Missing request validation**: Document required fields, data types, and constraints for every request body.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All required input files were read and logged.
- [ ] Every entity in SRS Section 3.2 maps to at least one API resource with CRUD endpoints.
- [ ] Every endpoint specifies authentication requirements, request/response schemas, and all applicable status codes.
- [ ] The error response format is consistent across all endpoints.
- [ ] List endpoints include pagination parameters and response metadata.
- [ ] The `openapi.yaml` file declares `openapi: 3.1.x` (or a recorded 3.2.x decision), parses with a 3.1-aware validator, and contains all endpoints defined in `API_Specification.md`.
- [ ] Every error response uses the RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` shape, and every `type`/`code` appears in the Error Code Registry.
- [ ] The rate-limit header scheme is documented as a project decision, not claimed as a standard.
- [ ] For long-lived or side-effecting APIs, the specification includes a consumer contract matrix, idempotency map, stable error-code registry with retryability, versioning/deprecation policy, and contract-test obligations.

## Standards

- **OpenAPI 3.1.x (current patch 3.1.2, 19 September 2025)**: Governs the structure of `openapi.yaml`; Schema Objects use the JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 dialect. OpenAPI 3.2.x is published and optional when the consumer toolchain supports it.
- **IEEE 29148-2018**: Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes -- Requirements engineering. Ensures traceability from requirements to API endpoints.
- **RFC 9110 (HTTP Semantics, STD 97)**: Defines method semantics and status codes; obsoletes RFC 7231.
- **RFC 9457 (Problem Details for HTTP APIs)**: Error response format; obsoletes RFC 7807.

Evidence/currentness (accessed 2026-09-24): spec.openapis.org/oas/ lists v3.1.2 as latest 3.1.x and v3.2.1 as latest 3.2.x; spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.2 confirms the JSON Schema 2020-12 dialect; rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9457 and rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9110 confirm status and obsoletions; datatracker.ietf.org shows draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers-11 (May 2026) still an Internet-Draft.
