# SaaS NFR Catalog (Phase 02 cross-cutting reference)

Reusable non-functional-requirement library for multi-tenant SaaS. Every NFR has: ID, statement, measurable threshold, verification method, source standard. Drop into Phase 02 `quality_standards.md` or directly into Section 3.x of the SRS.

## Usage in Phase 02

Drop relevant NFRs into Section 3 of the SRS. Each project picks the rows applicable, customises thresholds, and traces them to the per-tier SLO doc and the Multi-Tenancy Architecture Spec.
