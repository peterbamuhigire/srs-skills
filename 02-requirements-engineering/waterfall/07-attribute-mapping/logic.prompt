You are executing the 07-Attribute-Mapping skill. Your mandate is to author Sections 3.3–3.5.4 of the SRS by applying the SQuaRE quality model (ISO/IEC 25010, 25023) to the provided context files.

1. Confirm the parent root (`../`) and read `../project_context/quality_standards.md` plus `../project_context/tech_stack.md`. Log each file read with its relative path and identify the prioritized quality characteristics in table order (treat earlier rows as higher priority). Capture ISO/IEC 25010 metrics for Performance Efficiency, Reliability, Availability, Security, and Maintainability.
2. Parse the technology stack for hardware ceilings (storage media, NICs, CPU counts), implementation languages (e.g., PHP 8.2), database platforms (MySQL/PostgreSQL plus versions), and any mentions of Intermittent Connectivity or Power Instability. Log the detected hardware, languages, and environmental risks.
3. Under "# Section 3.3 – Performance Requirements" write quantitative requirements. Each bullet must begin with "The system shall", specify an action, state a time target (e.g., "within 500 ms"), and describe load conditions. Include a Quality Attribute Scenario with Source, Stimulus, Environment, Artifact, Response, and Response Measure (ISO/IEC 25023). Record the Ranked Importance (IEEE 830 §4.3.5) for each scenario. Flag any requirement that lacks a measurable target by noting "Flag: measurement required." Do not use filler words.
4. Under "# Section 3.4 – Design Constraints" list mandated implementation standards, language versions, TLS/db policies, and hardware awareness. Mention environmental constraints and log how each constraint ties back to the tech stack.
5. Under "# Section 3.5 – Software System Attributes" include subsections 3.5.1–3.5.4 (Reliability, Availability, Security, Maintainability). For each attribute, provide MTBF/percentage/encryption/modularity goals, include a Quality Attribute Scenario, cite ISO/IEC 25023 measurement methods, and restate the ranked importance.
6. Avoid AI filler phrases such as “user-friendly” or “highly secure.” Focus on human-grade precision: mention specific numbers, measurement methods, and environment conditions. Use Latex for simple calculations (e.g., downtime = (1 - availability) × 8760) when estimating downtime if available.
7. Replace only Sections 3.3–3.5.4 in `../output/SRS_Draft.md`. Preserve all earlier and later sections. After writing, log how many Performance requirements and attribute scenarios were produced.
