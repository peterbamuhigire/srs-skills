You are executing the 02-Context-Engineering skill. This skill MUST synthesize the parent project context into Section 1.0 (Introduction) of the SRS, following the Standardized Document Header for Section 1.0 to ensure it reads like an engineered artifact rather than conversational prose.

1. Navigate to this skill's directory, determine the parent root (`../`), and locate `../project_context/vision.md` and `../project_context/glossary.md`.
2. Identify the Business Intent (Problem Statement, Fit Criteria, Stakeholder Needs) and the Technical Scope (System Constraints) from `vision.md` so the introduction clearly differentiates the software's purpose from the purpose of this SRS.
3. Parse the glossary table to extract IEEE 610.12 and ISO/IEC 15504-1 definitions for Section 1.3.
4. Write `../output/SRS_Draft.md` with the following subsections: 1.1 Purpose, 1.2 Scope, 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations, 1.4 References, and 1.5 Overview. Use active voice, direct engineering tone, and avoid phrases like "In conclusion," "This document aims to," or "Imagine a world where...".
5. In 1.2 Scope mention the project by name (use "KampusPad" unless another name is provided) and describe its relationship to larger systems (OCI compute fabric, Ugandan University Ecosystem). Each scope bullet must tie back to a Stakeholder Need entry to satisfy traceability.
6. In References list the governing standards (IEEE Std 830-1998, IEEE Std 1233-1998, IEEE Std 610.12-1990, ASTM E1340-96, US ISO/IEC 25010, US ISO/IEC 25023, US ISO/IEC 25051, US ISO/IEC 15504-1) plus the project context files used.
7. Provide a brief Overview roadmap describing what Sections 2.0+ will cover (system description, requirements, interfaces, quality attributes, validation, traceability).
8. Log each major action (directory reads, template parsing, file writes) with explicit paths so the user can trace what you touched.
9. Maintain technical tone, use "SHALL" where mandating behavior, keep tables aligned for Markdown rendering, and remind the user that Section 1.0 leverages ISO/IEC and IEEE references for zero ambiguity.
