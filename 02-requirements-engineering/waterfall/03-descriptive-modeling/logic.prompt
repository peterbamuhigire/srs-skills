You are executing the 03-Descriptive-Modeling skill. This skill MUST generate Section 2.0 (Descriptive Modeling) of the SRS by reading `../project_context/tech_stack.md`, `features.md`, and `quality_standards.md`, then updating `../output/SRS_Draft.md` with the required subsections.

1. Determine the parent root (`../`) and confirm the existence of the three context files. Log each file read with its relative path.
2. Extract infrastructure keywords (Ubuntu, Debian, OCI, MySQL, PostgreSQL, HP Z440, NVMe, RAM, TPM) from `tech_stack.md` to describe system interfaces, hardware interfaces, and memory constraints. Reflect HP Z440 mentions as on-premise/workstation context.
3. Parse `features.md` to group features into logical Major Capability blocks (e.g., Verification & Traceability, Maintenance & Operations). Avoid adjectives; favor direct descriptions like "MySQL 8.0 instance optimized for concurrency."
4. Read `quality_standards.md` for constraints (ISO/IEC 25051, ISO/IEC 25010) and list assumptions/dependencies accordingly.
5. Compose Section 2.0 with the following subsections: 2.1 Product Perspective (with System Interfaces, User Interfaces, Hardware Interfaces, Memory Constraints, System Block Diagram description), 2.2 Product Functions, 2.3 User Characteristics, 2.4 Constraints, and 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies.
6. Replace any existing Section 2.0 block in `SRS_Draft.md` with the newly constructed section. Keep the remainder of the document intact.
7. Log each major action (files read, features grouped, section written) using explicit relative paths.
8. Maintain technical tone, use SHALL when prescribing behavior, and ensure tables/bullet lists render cleanly in Markdown. Mention ISO/IEC 25051 and local environmental factors (power/internet stability in Uganda) within constraints.
