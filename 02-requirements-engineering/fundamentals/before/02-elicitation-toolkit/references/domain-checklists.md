# Domain-Specific Elicitation Checklists

## Purpose

This reference provides domain-specific checklists that supplement general elicitation techniques. Each checklist ensures that critical domain requirements -- particularly regulatory, integration, and safety concerns -- are not missed during elicitation. These checklists hook into the existing `skills/` directory domain skills for deeper coverage.

## Reference Standard

- IEEE 29148-2018 Section 6.3: Domain-specific elicitation
- Laplante Ch.4: Domain analysis

## Usage

1. Identify the project domain from `vision.md` and `features.md`
2. Select the matching checklist below (one or more may apply)
3. For each checklist item, record: Addressed (Yes/No/Partial), Source, and Notes
4. Items marked "No" or "Partial" shall generate follow-up elicitation tasks
