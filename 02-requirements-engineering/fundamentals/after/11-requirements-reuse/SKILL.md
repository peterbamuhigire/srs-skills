# Requirements Reuse Skill Guidance

<!-- local-contract-start -->
<!-- dual-compat-start -->
## Use When

- curating approved reusable requirement patterns and product-line variants after a stable baseline exists; use requirements-patterns to structure one project's complex behaviour.
- Use this procedure when the required source artefacts are available and `Reusable requirements library` is the next lifecycle deliverable.

## Do Not Use When

- Use `requirements-patterns` when that neighbouring route owns the decision or deliverable.
- Do not invent missing project evidence, standards clauses, thresholds, or stakeholder decisions.

## Required Inputs

| Artefact | Source or provider | Required? | Behaviour when missing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Approved requirements, applicability context, variability rules, and provenance | Requirements baselines and product-line owner | Yes | Stop the affected step, name the missing source, and return only a qualified gap record. |

## Workflow

1. Inspect the required inputs and log the exact sources, versions, and unresolved assumptions.
2. Apply this skill's existing domain workflow and decision rules to produce `Reusable requirements library`.
3. Stop when a required source, accountable decision owner, or deterministic test oracle is absent.
4. Recover by preserving valid work, marking the blocked scope, and returning the narrowest qualified artefact plus the next evidence needed.

## Outputs

| Artefact | Consumer | Acceptance condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reusable requirements library | Future project teams and requirements governance | Required sections are populated, source links resolve, and every material requirement or decision has an observable review or test oracle. |

## Evidence Produced

| Evidence | Reviewer | Acceptance condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source, decision, trace, and validation record for `Reusable requirements library` | Requirements quality reviewer | Inputs used, decisions made, checks run, failures, and unassessed items are explicit. |

## Capability and permission boundaries

Read and search are required. Editing is allowed only when the request authorises creation or repair of the named requirements artefact. Publishing, production mutation, destructive action, spending, and certification require explicit authority.

## Degraded mode

Fallback: if a required file, reviewer, standard source, network check, renderer, or execution capability is unavailable, return the narrowest useful qualified result and mark the affected check `not assessed`; never convert an unassessed check into a pass.

## Decision Rules

| Choice or condition | Action | Failure or risk avoided |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A candidate requirement depends on hidden project-specific context | Keep it local or parameterise and test the variability explicitly. | Reused requirements that import wrong assumptions. |
| Required inputs and test oracles are complete | Continue through the existing workflow and record evidence. | A deliverable whose acceptance cannot be reproduced. |
| A mandatory source or owner is missing | Stop the affected branch and issue a qualified gap record. | Fabricated context or unauthorised decisions. |

## Quality Standards

- Preserve stable identifiers and bidirectional traceability from project evidence to `Reusable requirements library` and its acceptance checks.
- Apply ISO/IEEE measures only with a named metric, method, threshold, evidence source, and responsible reviewer; run the anti-slop gate before release.

## Anti-Patterns

- Producing `Reusable requirements library` from assumed context. Fix: cite the project source or mark the scope blocked.
- Accepting a material requirement without a deterministic oracle. Fix: add a measurable result, boundary, and verification method.
- Crossing into `requirements-patterns` without routing the decision. Fix: hand off the named input and preserve trace links.
- Treating an unavailable check as passed. Fix: mark it `not assessed` and state the release consequence.
- Claiming standards, statutory, or stakeholder approval without evidence. Fix: cite the source and reviewer or qualify the claim.

## Overview

This skill is OPTIONAL and intended for organizations building multiple related products or maintaining a portfolio of applications. It scans existing requirements artifacts, identifies candidates for reuse, classifies them by reuse type, and generates a requirements library catalog. The library accelerates future projects by providing vetted, parameterized requirements templates.

## When to Use This Skill

- After requirements have been baselined and validated for at least one project.
- When an organization is starting a second or subsequent product that shares domain characteristics.
- During product line engineering to establish commonality and variability models.
- When regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX) recur across multiple systems.

## Quick Reference

- **Inputs:** All artifacts in `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/`, `projects/<ProjectName>/_context/vision.md`
- **Outputs:** `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/requirements_library.md`
- **Tone:** Cataloging, systematic, pattern-oriented

## Input Files

| File | Source | Required? |
|------|--------|-----------|
| All `*.md` artifacts | `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/` | Yes |
| `vision.md` | `projects/<ProjectName>/_context/` | Yes |
| `requirements_baseline.md` | `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/` | Recommended |
| `traceability_matrix.md` | `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/` | Recommended |

## Output Files

| File | Contents | Destination |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `requirements_library.md` | Reusable requirements catalog with classification and adaptation guidelines | `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/` |

## Core Instructions

### Step 1: Read All Artifacts

Read every file in `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/` and `projects/<ProjectName>/_context/vision.md`. Log each file path read. Build a consolidated list of all requirements with their full definitions, acceptance criteria, and trace links.

### Step 2: Identify Reuse Candidates

Scan all requirements for patterns that indicate reuse potential. Candidates fall into three categories:

#### Cross-Cutting Concerns

Requirements that appear in virtually every software system:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Authentication | User registration, login, password reset, session management, MFA |
| Authorization | Role-based access control, permission matrices, privilege escalation prevention |
| Logging | Audit trails, event logging, log retention policies, log format standards |
| Error Handling | Error codes, user-facing error messages, retry logic, graceful degradation |
| Data Validation | Input sanitization, format validation, boundary checks, encoding rules |
| Notification | Email dispatch, SMS alerts, in-app notifications, notification preferences |

#### Domain Patterns

Requirements specific to a business domain but recurring across products in that domain:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| E-Commerce | Shopping cart, checkout flow, payment processing, order tracking, returns |
| Healthcare | Patient registration, appointment scheduling, prescription management, HIPAA consent |
| Finance | Account management, transaction processing, regulatory reporting, fraud detection |
| Education | Course enrollment, grade management, attendance tracking, learning management |

#### Regulatory and Compliance

Requirements mandated by law or regulation that apply to any system within scope:

| Regulation | Requirements |
|------------|-------------|
| GDPR | Consent management, right to erasure, data portability, privacy impact assessment |
| HIPAA | Business Associate Agreement, PHI encryption, access logging, breach notification |
| SOX | Financial controls, audit trails, segregation of duties, data retention |
| PCI DSS | Cardholder data protection, network segmentation, vulnerability management |
| WCAG 2.1 | Perceivable, operable, understandable, robust accessibility requirements |

### Step 3: Classify Reuse Type

For each candidate requirement, classify the reuse type:

| Reuse Type | Definition | When to Use |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Verbatim | Copy the requirement as-is into the new project | Regulatory mandates, universal standards |
| Parameterized | Use a template with variables to fill in | Domain patterns with project-specific values |
| Pattern | Adapt the structure and intent but rewrite specifics | Cross-cutting concerns with varying implementations |

#### Verbatim Reuse Example

```
[LIB-SEC-001] The system shall encrypt all data at rest using AES-256.
Type: Verbatim | Domain: Security | Regulation: HIPAA, PCI DSS
```

#### Parameterized Reuse Example

```
[LIB-AUTH-001] The system shall lock the user account after
{MAX_ATTEMPTS} consecutive failed login attempts for {LOCKOUT_DURATION}.
Type: Parameterized | Domain: Authentication
Parameters: MAX_ATTEMPTS (integer, default: 5), LOCKOUT_DURATION (minutes, default: 15)
```

#### Pattern Reuse Example

```
[LIB-NOTIFY-001] The system shall deliver {NOTIFICATION_TYPE} notifications
to {RECIPIENT_ROLE} within {DELIVERY_SLA} of {TRIGGER_EVENT}.
Type: Pattern | Domain: Notification
Structure: Trigger -> Channel -> Recipient -> SLA
```

### Step 4: Generate Library Catalog

For each reusable requirement, create a catalog entry:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Library ID | LIB-[DOMAIN]-[NNN] |
| Category | Cross-cutting, Domain, or Regulatory |
| Domain | Authentication, Security, E-Commerce, etc. |
| Reuse Type | Verbatim, Parameterized, or Pattern |
| Description | The requirement text or template |
| Parameters | Variables that must be filled (parameterized/pattern only) |
| Defaults | Default values for parameters |
| Constraints | Conditions under which this requirement applies |
| Source Projects | Projects where this requirement has been used |
| Usage Count | Number of times reused across projects |
| Last Used | Date of most recent reuse |
| Validation Status | Verified, Unverified, or Deprecated |
| Standards | Applicable IEEE/ISO/regulatory standards |

### Step 5: Define Adaptation Guidelines

Document the process for reusing requirements from the library in new projects:

1. **Search:** Query the library by domain, category, or keyword.
2. **Evaluate:** Assess applicability to the target project context.
3. **Adapt:** For parameterized and pattern types, fill in project-specific values.
4. **Validate:** Verify the adapted requirement against the target project's vision and constraints.
5. **Register:** Add the new usage to the library's usage tracking.
6. **Trace:** Establish trace links from the reused requirement to target project business goals.

### Step 6: Commonality and Variability Analysis

For product line engineering, perform commonality/variability analysis:

- **Common Requirements:** Requirements shared by all products in the product line (mandatory inclusion).
- **Variable Requirements:** Requirements that differ between products (variation points).
- **Optional Requirements:** Requirements included only in specific product variants.

Document variation points with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Variation Point ID | VP-[NNN] |
| Description | What varies across products |
| Variants | List of possible options |
| Binding Time | Design-time, build-time, or runtime |
| Default Variant | The variant used when no explicit choice is made |

### Step 7: Generate Output

Write `projects/<ProjectName>/<phase>/<document>/requirements_library.md` following the output format below.

## Output Format

### requirements_library.md

```markdown
# Requirements Library: [Project Name]

**Generated:** [Date]
**Standards:** IEEE 29148-2018, Laplante Ch.9

## Common Pitfalls

- **Premature generalization:** Do not extract a pattern from a single instance. A requirement is a reuse candidate only after it has appeared in at least one project and has clear cross-project applicability.
- **Over-parameterization:** Too many parameters make a template harder to use than writing from scratch. Limit parameterized templates to 5 or fewer variables.
- **Stale library entries:** Requirements that reference obsolete technologies or superseded regulations shall be marked Deprecated and excluded from new project reuse.
- **Ignoring context:** A requirement that works in one domain may be harmful in another. Always validate adapted requirements against the target project's specific constraints.
- **Copy without trace:** Reused requirements must still be traced to the target project's business goals. Reuse does not exempt a requirement from traceability obligations.
