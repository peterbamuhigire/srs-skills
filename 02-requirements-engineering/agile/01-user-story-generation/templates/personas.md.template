3. **Goals**: What they want to achieve
4. **Pain Points**: Current frustrations or challenges
5. **Behaviors**: How they interact with similar systems
6. **Quote**: A representative statement capturing their mindset

## Persona Prioritization

| Persona | Primary? | Frequency of Use | Business Impact | Design Priority |
|---------|----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [Persona 1 name] | ✅ Yes | Daily | High | 1 (Highest) |
| [Persona 2 name] | No | Weekly | Medium | 2 |
| [Persona 3 name] | No | Monthly | Low | 3 |

**Note:** User stories should prioritize Primary personas first.

## Anti-Personas (Out of Scope)

List user types that are **NOT** target users for this system:

- **[Anti-persona 1]:** [Why they're not a target user]
- **[Anti-persona 2]:** [Why they're not a target user]

This helps avoid feature creep by clearly defining who we're NOT building for.

- [ ] Personas are based on **real user research** (interviews, surveys, existing data)
- [ ] **Primary persona** is clearly identified (80% of user stories will serve them)
- [ ] Pain points are **specific and measurable**, not vague ("slow" → "checkout takes >3 min")
- [ ] Demographics are **relevant** to system design (don't include irrelevant details)
- [ ] Anti-personas help **prevent scope creep**

**Instructions for AI:**

1. Use these personas to generate user stories in the format: "As a [persona], I want [action], so that [benefit]"
2. Prioritize stories for Primary personas first
3. Ensure acceptance criteria address persona-specific pain points
4. Tag stories with persona names for backlog filtering
