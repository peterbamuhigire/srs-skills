## Functional Requirement Patterns

- The system shall create balanced journal entries automatically for every posted financial business event.
- The system shall prevent deletion or direct editing of posted entries and shall correct them only through reversals or approved adjustment entries.
- The system shall reconcile each subledger control balance to the general ledger for each fiscal period.
- The system shall prevent transactions from posting into a closed period except through an approved reopening or adjustment workflow.
- The system shall store source-document evidence and link it to the accounting event, posting, approval, and report line.
- The system shall maintain cost center, profit center, project, branch, product, customer, supplier, and tax dimensions where relevant to management reporting.
- The system shall produce period-end financial statements that can be regenerated from the underlying transactions and journals.

## IFRS-Aware Elicitation

Ask whether the system must support:

- Accrual accounting or cash basis.
- Revenue recognition rules by product, service, contract, subscription, milestone, delivery, or usage.
- Inventory costing method and net realizable value review.
- Depreciation, impairment, disposal, and asset custody.
- Leases, loans, interest, effective-rate calculations, provisions, and contingent obligations.
- Foreign currency transactions and remeasurement.
- Consolidated reporting, intercompany transactions, eliminations, and non-controlling interests.
- Fair-value, impairment, revaluation, and write-down workflows for balances that cannot remain at simple historical cost.
- Accounting-policy, estimate-change, and prior-period-error workflows if statutory reporting or audit readiness is required.

## Cost And Control Requirements

- For manufacturing, processing, logistics, and inventory-heavy systems, specify job/process/hybrid costing, bill of materials, yield, scrap, rework, overhead absorption, variance analysis, and production capacity.
- For service businesses, specify project costing, timesheets, utilization, recoverable expenses, WIP, deferred revenue, and milestone billing.
- For branches/franchises, specify transfer pricing, interbranch transfers, responsibility-center reporting, and branch P&L.
- For donor/grant work, specify fund accounting, budget line controls, eligible cost checks, expenditure evidence, and restricted-fund reporting.
- For group or multi-entity systems, specify intercompany invoicing, settlement, elimination, consolidation adjustments, ownership percentages, non-controlling interests, and group reporting packs.
- For loan, lease, or investment modules, specify amortization schedules, effective interest, principal/interest splits, current/non-current classification, covenants, and maturity reporting.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Posting tests prove debit total equals credit total for each event and batch.
- Trial balance, subledger reports, and financial statements reconcile for a sample period.
- Reversal tests prove the audit trail remains intact and balances reverse correctly.
- Role tests prove users cannot approve their own high-risk transactions.
- Period-close tests prove late transactions are blocked or routed to approved adjustments.
- Report tests prove figures trace from source document to journal to ledger to statement.
