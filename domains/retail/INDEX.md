## Evidence Basis

This retail expansion is based on the internal digital-research project `umbrex-retail-playbooks-engine-enhancement`, which extracted 20 public Umbrex retail playbooks and converted them into engine implementation recommendations. Treat Umbrex pages as primary publisher evidence for the corpus structure and topics, not as independent proof of market statistics, legal requirements, or accounting treatment.
