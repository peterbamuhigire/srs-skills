# Professional Word Output

Two things kill document quality equally: bad design and bad writing. A document must pass **both** tests. This skill addresses both.

**Reference files (read when needed):**
- `references/typography-layout.md` — fonts, spacing, margins, colour palettes, visual hierarchy
- `references/written-communication.md` — structure, clarity, tone, anti-patterns
- `references/word-features.md` — styles, TOC, tables, images, sections, cover pages, watermarks
- `references/quality-checklist.md` — pre-delivery checklist (run before every delivery)

---

## The Standard

Every document produced must pass this bar: **a professional communications specialist and a document designer would both be satisfied**. This means:

1. Every typographic decision is intentional and consistent
2. The writing is clear, structured, and free of AI-slop vocabulary
3. Navigation elements (TOC, headers/footers, page numbers) are complete and correct
4. Visual hierarchy guides the reader without effort
5. The document looks the same on any machine (styles, not direct formatting)

---

## Production Pipeline

Documents are produced via **Pandoc + python-docx + reference.docx template**:

```
Markdown source (structured content)
    ↓ pandoc --reference-doc=templates/reference.docx
.docx (styles applied from reference.docx)
    ↓ manual python-docx post-processing (cover page, TOC, header/footer)
Final .docx → PDF export
```

### Build commands

```bash
# Single document
pandoc source.md -o output.docx --reference-doc=templates/reference.docx

# With table of contents
pandoc source.md -o output.docx --reference-doc=templates/reference.docx --toc --toc-depth=3

# Rebuild reference.docx from scratch
python scripts/create-reference-docx.py
```

---

## Style System

Pandoc maps Markdown elements to named Word styles in reference.docx. **Never bypass this with direct formatting.**

| Markdown element | Word style |
|---|---|
| `# Heading` | Heading 1 |
| `## Heading` | Heading 2 |
| `### Heading` | Heading 3 |
| `#### Heading` | Heading 4 |
| Body paragraph | Normal |
| `` ```code block``` `` | Source Code / Verbatim |
| `` `inline code` `` | Verbatim Char |
| `> blockquote` | Block Text |
| Table | Table Grid |
| YAML `title:` | Title |
| YAML `subtitle:` | Subtitle |
| `*Caption*` below figure/table | Caption |

**If a style needs to change, change it in reference.docx — never in the document directly.**

---

## Heading Flow & Page Break Rules

These rules are **mandatory**. They determine how the document breathes across pages and whether the reader can follow the structure without effort.

### Rule 1 — Heading 1 always starts a new page

Every `# Heading 1` forces a page break before it. Major sections never share a page with the section that precedes them. This makes the document scannable: readers flipping through pages immediately see where each chapter/section begins.

**Word setting:** Paragraph → Line and Page Breaks → **Page break before = ON**

**python-docx:**
```python
from docx.oxml.ns import qn
from docx.oxml import OxmlElement

h1 = doc.styles['Heading 1']
h1.paragraph_format.page_break_before = True
h1.paragraph_format.keep_with_next = True   # heading never orphaned alone
```

### Rule 2 — Heading 2 and Heading 3 stay with their first paragraph

If the heading plus its first following paragraph do not **entirely fit** on the current page, the whole unit moves to the next page. A heading that appears at the bottom of a page with its content on the next page is a design failure.

**Word settings on Heading 2 and Heading 3:**
- Paragraph → Line and Page Breaks → **Keep with next = ON**
- Paragraph → Line and Page Breaks → **Keep lines together = ON**

**Word setting on Normal / body paragraphs:**
- Paragraph → Line and Page Breaks → **Keep lines together = ON**

This combination means: the heading is glued to the paragraph that follows it, and that paragraph will not be split across pages. If the pair doesn't fit, both move to the next page.

**python-docx:**
```python
for style_name in ['Heading 2', 'Heading 3']:
    style = doc.styles[style_name]
    style.paragraph_format.keep_with_next = True
    style.paragraph_format.keep_together = True

# Body paragraphs: never split mid-paragraph
doc.styles['Normal'].paragraph_format.keep_together = True
```

### Rule 3 — Widow and orphan control is always on

No paragraph's first line appears alone at the bottom of a page (orphan), and no paragraph's last line appears alone at the top of a page (widow).

**Word setting:** Paragraph → Line and Page Breaks → **Widow/Orphan control = ON** (this is the Word default but must be confirmed in reference.docx).

```python
doc.styles['Normal'].paragraph_format.widow_control = True
```

### Summary table — paragraph flow settings per style

| Style | Page break before | Keep with next | Keep lines together | Widow/orphan |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Heading 1 | **ON** | ON | — | — |
| Heading 2 | OFF | **ON** | **ON** | — |
| Heading 3 | OFF | **ON** | **ON** | — |
| Heading 4 | OFF | ON | ON | — |
| Normal | OFF | OFF | **ON** | **ON** |
| Body Text | OFF | OFF | **ON** | **ON** |
| Caption | OFF | OFF | OFF | OFF |

### What this looks like in the document

- Opening a document and scanning: each major section (H1) occupies its own visual territory — top of a fresh page
- Reading through body content: the eye never arrives at an H2/H3 sitting stranded at the bottom of a page; the heading is always above its content
- Short paragraphs never lose their first or last line to a page break
- The result is a document that reads like it was **typeset**, not generated

## Typography Specification

Read `references/typography-layout.md` for full font stacks and spacing tables. The standard corporate stack:

| Element | Font | Size | Colour |
|---|---|---|---|
| Title | Calibri Light | 28pt Bold | #1F3864 |
| Heading 1 | Calibri Light | 16pt Bold | #1F3864 |
| Heading 2 | Calibri Light | 13pt Bold | #2E5D8A |
| Heading 3 | Calibri | 11pt Bold | #4472C4 |
| Body / Normal | Calibri | 11pt Regular | #262626 |
| Code | Consolas | 9.5pt Regular | #1A1A1A |
| Caption | Calibri | 9pt Regular | #595959 |
| Header/Footer | Calibri | 9pt Regular | #595959 |

**Heading 1 visual anchor:** 4.5pt navy left border bar — applied via style paragraph border, not manual formatting.

---

## Spacing Rules

**Never press Enter twice to create space.** Use style space-after settings.

| Style | Before | After | Line |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heading 1 | 20pt | 6pt | Single |
| Heading 2 | 14pt | 4pt | Single |
| Heading 3 | 10pt | 3pt | Single |
| Normal | 0pt | 6pt | 1.15× |

---

## Document Structure (every document)

### 1. Cover Page

```yaml
---
title: "Project Name — Document Title"
subtitle: "Document Type — Category"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
version: "1.0"
status: "Draft | Review | Final"
---
```

Followed immediately by an ownership table:

```markdown
| | |
|---|---|
| **Project** | Project Name |
| **Owner** | Organisation Name |
| **Author** | Author Name |
| **Version** | 1.0 Draft |
| **Date** | 2026-04-05 |
| **Classification** | Confidential — Internal Use Only |
```

Cover page has no header/footer (set `different_first_page_header_footer = True`).

### 2. Table of Contents

Required for all documents longer than 5 pages. Generated automatically from Heading 1/2/3 styles.

### 3. Body Content

Three-part structure at every level:
- **Introduction** — context and purpose (what this section covers)
- **Development** — main content, evidence, detail
- **Conclusion** — key takeaway or next action

### 4. Headers and Footers

**Header:** Document title (field) right-aligned, thin grey rule below.

**Footer:** "Page X of Y" centred, confidentiality notice left, print date right.

---

## Table Design

Tables must look designed, not dumped. Read `references/word-features.md` → Tables section.

```markdown
| Column A | Column B | Column C |
|---|---|---|
| Data | Data | Data |
```

**Standard table spec:**
- Header row: Navy fill (#1F3864), white bold 10pt text
- Banded rows: light blue tint (#F2F7FD) / white alternating
- Outside border: 1pt, #1F3864
- Inside grid: 0.5pt, #BBBBBB
- Caption below every table: "Table N: Description"
- Header row repeats on every page for tables spanning multiple pages

---

## Images and Figures

- Every figure needs a caption below: "Figure N: Description" (Caption style)
- Apply a 1pt grey border (#CCCCCC) to framed figures
- Minimum 150 DPI for print documents
- Use PNG for diagrams; JPEG for photographs
- Never stretch images — use corner handles only

---

## Written Communication Standards

Read `references/written-communication.md` for full guidance. Core rules:

**Structure:** Inverted pyramid — most important information first, at every level (document, section, paragraph, sentence).

**Sentences:** 15–20 words average. One idea per sentence. Active voice.

**Never use:**
- "Delve into", "leverage", "robust", "seamlessly", "in today's landscape"
- Vague adjectives without metrics ("fast", "powerful", "intuitive")
- Passive voice for instructions ("The button should be clicked" → "Click the button")
- Undefined acronyms on first use
- Numbered lists for non-sequential items
- Bullet lists for sequential steps

**Always include:**
- Clear topic sentence opening every section
- Logical connectors at paragraph transitions
- Examples to illustrate abstract claims
- Measurable specifics in place of vague adjectives

---

## Cover Page Design Principles

A professional cover page contains:

1. **Brand bar** — full-width colour block (1.5–2 cm height), primary brand colour
2. **Company logo** — top-left or centred within brand bar
3. **Document title** — 28–36pt, Light weight, high contrast against background
4. **Subtitle and metadata** — version, date, status
5. **Ownership table** — structured metadata block
6. **No header/footer** — the cover page IS the identifier

---

## Watermarks

Apply when document status requires it:
- **DRAFT** — grey diagonal, 50% transparency, 80pt Calibri Semi-Bold
- **CONFIDENTIAL** — grey diagonal, same spec
- **INTERNAL USE ONLY** — same spec

Insert: Design → Page Background → Watermark → Custom Watermark.

---

## Markdown Source Quality Rules

These patterns degrade Word output — do not use them:

| Bad pattern | Why | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `*` for bullet lists | Inconsistent in some Pandoc builds | Use `-` only |
| Setext headings (`---` underline) | Ambiguous, not parsed correctly | Use `#` ATX only |
| Code blocks inside table cells | Breaks table rendering | Move code outside tables |
| Raw HTML tags | Does not render in .docx | Use Markdown equivalents |
| `**bold**` + `*italic*` combined | Inconsistent output | Use one or the other |
| Blank lines instead of spacing | Creates erratic spacing | Let styles handle space |

---

## Pre-Delivery

Before every delivery, run `references/quality-checklist.md` in full. The minimum final actions:

1. `Ctrl+A → F9` — update all fields (TOC, page numbers, dates)
2. Review → Spelling & Grammar — fix all issues
3. File → Info → Inspect Document — remove comments, tracked changes, metadata
4. File → Print → verify print preview (no widows, no blank pages)
5. Export PDF with accessibility tags enabled
6. Name file: `ProjectName_DocumentType_v1.0_YYYY-MM-DD.docx`

---

## Customisation Reference

To change global document styling, edit `scripts/create-reference-docx.py`:

| What to change | Location in script |
|---|---|
| Heading colours | `NAVY`, `STEEL`, `ACCENT` constants |
| Body/heading font | `FONT_BODY`, `FONT_HEADING` constants |
| Code font | `FONT_CODE` constant |
| Heading 1 border weight | `sz` attribute in `pBdr` block |
| Footer content | `footer` section |
| Page size and margins | `section.left_margin` etc. |

Rebuild after changes:
```bash
python scripts/create-reference-docx.py
bash scripts/build-doc.sh <doc-dir> <output-name>
```
