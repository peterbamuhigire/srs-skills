# SDLC-Docs-Engine Project Brief

## What Is This?

**SDLC-Docs-Engine** (v3.3) is an AI-powered, standards-driven documentation generator that creates **comprehensive, IEEE/ISO-compliant documentation** across all phases of software development.

**Think of it as:** A portable "Documentation Engine" whose skill entrypoints live under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, read your project context, and generate professional documentation for **Waterfall, Agile, or Hybrid** methodologies.

---

## What's New in v3.3?

**Complete SDLC Coverage** (March 2026) - 23 new documentation skills across 6 phases, bringing the engine to **100% phase coverage**:

**Phase 04: Development Artifacts** - Technical specs, coding standards, dev setup, contribution guides (IEEE 730, IEEE 1074)

**Phase 05: Testing Documentation** - Test strategy, test plans, test reports (IEEE 829)

**Phase 06: Deployment & Operations** - Deployment guides, runbooks, monitoring, infrastructure docs (IEEE 1062, SRE, ISO 25010)

**Phase 07: Agile Artifacts** - Sprint planning, Definition of Done/Ready, retrospective templates (Scrum Guide, IEEE 29148)

**Phase 08: End-User Documentation** - User manuals, installation guides, FAQs, release notes (ISO 26514, IEEE 830)

**Phase 09: Governance & Compliance** - Traceability matrix, audit reports, compliance docs, risk assessment (IEEE 1012, GDPR/HIPAA/SOC2, ISO 31000)

**Total: 46 documentation generation skills across all 10 SDLC phases.**

## What Was New in v3.2?

**Documentation Skills Expansion** (February 2026) - 11 new skills across 3 phases:
- **Phase 01: Strategic Vision** - Vision Statement, PRD, Business Case (IEEE 29148, IEEE 1058)
- **Phase 02: Agile Track Complete** - Acceptance Criteria, Story Mapping, Backlog Prioritization (IEEE 29148)
- **Phase 03: Design Documentation** - HLD, LLD, API Specification, Database Design (IEEE 1016, OpenAPI 3.0)
- **Infrastructure:** Setup scripts (PowerShell + Bash) for bootstrapping new SRS projects

## What Was New in v3.1?



**AI-Assisted Development Skills** - Skills that enhance Claude Code's ability to help you develop software:

- **ai-assisted-development**: Orchestrate multiple AI agents (30-75% faster through parallelization)
- **ai-error-prevention**: 7 strategies to catch Claude's mistakes early (saves 50-75% of tokens)
- **orchestration-best-practices**: The 10 Commandments of Orchestration
- **ai-error-handling**: 5-layer validation stack for AI-generated code
- **Reference guides**: Prompting patterns, orchestration patterns, encoding patterns into skills

## What Was New in v3.0?

Previously called **SRS-Skills** (focused only on IEEE 830 SRS generation), v3.0 expanded to support:

- ✅ **Multi-Methodology Support**: Waterfall (IEEE 830 SRS) + Agile (User Stories) + Hybrid
- ✅ **23 Document Types**: PRD, SRS, User Stories, HLD, LLD, API Specs, Test Plans, Runbooks, Manuals, Compliance Docs
- ✅ **10 SDLC Phases**: From strategic vision to governance/compliance
- ✅ **Methodology Detection**: Automatic project analysis and recommendation (Phase 00)
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing Waterfall SRS pipeline preserved

---

## How It Works

### 1. Install as Submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/peterbamuhigire/srs-skills.git skills
cd skills
```

### 2. Select Methodology

```bash
Run skill: skills/00-meta-initialization
```

The engine scans your project and recommends Waterfall, Agile, or Hybrid based on:
- Regulatory requirements (FDA, FAA, HIPAA)
- Project type (startup, enterprise, government)
- Development pace (commit frequency, sprint structure)
- Team structure and size

### 3. Generate Documentation

**For Waterfall:**
```bash
Run: 02-requirements-engineering/waterfall/01-initialize-srs
# ... run phases 02-08 sequentially
Output: SRS_Draft.md (IEEE 830), Traceability_Matrix.md, Audit_Report.md
```

**For Agile:**
```bash
Run: 02-requirements-engineering/agile/01-user-story-generation
Output: user_stories.md, story_map.mmd, backlog_summary.md
```

### 4. Expand to Other Phases

```bash
Run: 03-design-documentation/01-high-level-design
Run: 05-testing-documentation/02-test-plans
Run: 06-deployment-operations/02-runbook-generation
```

## Migration from v2.x

Existing SRS-Skills users:

**Old structure:**
```
01-initialize-srs/
02-context-engineering/
... (at root level)
```

**New structure (v3.0):**
```
02-requirements-engineering/waterfall/01-initialize-srs/
02-requirements-engineering/waterfall/02-context-engineering/
... (moved to waterfall subdirectory)
```

**Backward compatible:** Legacy paths still work with deprecation notices.

See `docs/MIGRATION_V2_TO_V3.md` for complete migration guide.
