"""Module-aware identifier scanning.

This is the single source of truth for recognizing project identifiers in
artifact text. It deliberately supports **module-prefixed** IDs (``FR-COOP-011``,
``NFR-PLAT-002``, ``CTRL-HC-001``) in addition to the classic single-segment
form (``FR-001``), and it matches IDs whether or not they are wrapped in bold
(``**FR-001**``).

It is intentionally NOT used by ``ArtifactGraph.all_identifiers()`` — that
narrow, bold-only surface still feeds the traceability / design-sufficiency /
phaseNN gates, whose line-level heuristics are calibrated for the classic form.
Broadening those would change validation semantics for every project. Instead,
this scanner powers only the three places that benefit from a content-bearing,
module-aware view: ``sync`` (registry population), the identifier-registry
check, and ``baseline`` snapshotting.

Prefix recognition is an **allowlist**: over-matching would turn tokens like
``AES-256`` / ``SHA-256`` / ``ISO-27001`` into phantom identifiers and break
projects, whereas under-matching is harmless (an unrecognized prefix is simply
left untracked, exactly as before this module existed). To track a new prefix,
add it to ``KIND_PREFIXES``.
