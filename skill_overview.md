# Skill Pipeline Registry

This registry documents the inputs, process logic, governing standards, and outputs for each skill in the SRS-Skills pipeline. It is formatted as an Engineering Interface Control Document to ensure compliance with ISO/IEC 15504 and IEEE 1002 taxonomy requirements.

| Skill ID & Name | Inputs | Process Logic | Governing Standard | Primary Output |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 01-initialize-srs | User input, existing context, project anchors | Populate ../project_context/ with IEEE/ISO-driven templates, ensuring baseline artifacts and seeds exist | ISO/IEC 15504 – Process Assessment Framework; IEEE 1074 – Software Life Cycle Process | Seeded templates in ../project_context/ (vision.md, tech_stack.md, features.md, business_rules.md, quality_standards.md, glossary.md) |
| 02-context-engineering | ../project_context/vision.md, glossary.md | Synthesize Introduction, Purpose, and Definition sections guided by stakeholder vision and terminology | IEEE 830 Clause 5.1 – Introduction | ../output/SRS_Draft.md Section 1.0 (Purpose, Scope, Definitions) |
| 03-descriptive-modeling | ../project_context/tech_stack.md, features.md | Map environment, constraints, and capability descriptions, aligning system context with feature candidates | IEEE 830 Clause 5.2 – Overall Description | ../output/SRS_Draft.md Section 2.0 (Overall Description, System Overview) |
| 04-interface-specification | ../project_context/tech_stack.md | Conduct connectivity and interface audit versus infrastructure stack, documenting protocols and interoperability controls | IEEE 1233 – System Requirements Development; ISO/IEC 25051 – Software Product Quality Requirements | ../output/SRS_Draft.md Section 3.1 (External Interfaces) |
| 05-feature-decomposition | ../project_context/features.md | Break down functional capabilities into stimulus/response pairs with verifiable SHALL statements | IEEE 830 Clause 5.3.1 – Functional Requirements (Feature-Based) | ../output/SRS_Draft.md Section 3.2 (Functional Requirements) |
| 06-logic-modeling | ../project_context/business_rules.md | Formalize algorithms, formulas, and decision tables (LaTeX where appropriate), capturing logic invariants for requirements | IEEE 1016 – Standards for Software Design Descriptions (Logic Mapping) | ../output/SRS_Draft.md Sections 3.2.x (Data/Logic Details) |
| 07-attribute-mapping | ../project_context/quality_standards.md | Enforce NFR metrics, describing performance, security, reliability, and other quality attributes with traceable targets | ISO/IEC 25010 – Software Product Quality | ../output/SRS_Draft.md Sections 3.3–3.6 (Attribute-based Requirements) |
| 08-semantic-auditing | ../output/SRS_Draft.md (full draft) | Validate completeness, consistency, and traceability; generate audit report and requirements traceability matrix | IEEE 1012 – Verification & Validation | ../output/Traceability_Matrix.md and Audit_Report.md (plus updated SRS draft sections) |

## Verification Gateways

1. Each skill ingests the output of the preceding phase as its baseline artifact (e.g., Skill 02 uses the vision/glossary created by Skill 01). This ensures traceability of inputs back to original templates.
2. Skill 05 requires the Feature catalog generated by Skills 01–03; Skill 06 and Skill 07 enforce data/logic and quality attributes flowing from Skill 05 definitions.
3. Skill 08 performs the terminal verification gate: it reads the entire SRS draft produced by Skills 02–07, confirms compliance with the cited standards, and emits the traceability matrix plus audit report. Passing Skill 08 is mandatory before any new iteration of Skill 01 to preserve integrity across the pipeline.
