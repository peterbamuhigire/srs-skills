## Verification Gateways

1. Each skill ingests the output of the preceding phase as its baseline artifact (e.g., Skill 02 uses the vision/glossary created by Skill 01). This ensures traceability of inputs back to original templates.
2. Skill 05 requires the Feature catalog generated by Skills 01–03; Skill 06 and Skill 07 enforce data/logic and quality attributes flowing from Skill 05 definitions.
3. Skill 08 performs the terminal verification gate: it reads the entire SRS draft produced by Skills 02–07, confirms compliance with the cited standards, and emits the traceability matrix plus audit report. Passing Skill 08 is mandatory before any new iteration of Skill 01 to preserve integrity across the pipeline.
4. Phase 01 (Strategic Vision) produces Vision_Statement.md and PRD.md that feed into Phase 02 as upstream context. Business_Case.md provides the go/no-go decision gate.
5. Phase 02 Agile track skills execute sequentially: user stories → acceptance criteria → story mapping → backlog prioritization. Each consumes the prior skill's output.
6. Phase 03 (Design Documentation) requires Phase 02 outputs (SRS_Draft.md or user_stories.md). HLD runs first; LLD, API Spec, and Database Design can run in parallel after HLD completes. Each design artifact traces back to SRS requirements.
7. Phase 04 (Development Artifacts) skills are independent and may run in any order after Phase 03 design docs are available.
8. Phase 05 (Testing Documentation) executes sequentially: test strategy → test plan → test report. Test strategy establishes the framework; test plan requires it as input.
9. Phase 06 (Deployment & Operations) skills are largely independent. Deployment guide typically runs first; runbook and monitoring can run in parallel after it.
10. Phase 07 (Agile Artifacts) skills are independent and may run in any order. Sprint planning typically references Phase 02 agile outputs (prioritized backlog, user stories).
11. Phase 08 (End-User Documentation) skills are independent. User manual and installation guide are typically generated first as they are most critical for end users.
12. Phase 09 (Governance & Compliance) is the terminal verification phase. Run 01-traceability-matrix first as it feeds the audit report. Skills 03 (compliance) and 04 (risk) are independent and can run in parallel after 01 and 02 complete.
